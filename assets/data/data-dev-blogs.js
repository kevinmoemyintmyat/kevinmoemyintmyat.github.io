Some certifications require ongoing study and may expire, which is actually a good thing - it encourages continuous learning. Even experienced developers with certifications sometimes need to look up specific details when working with technologies they haven\'t used recently.

Developers often support each other\'s work, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. Some projects get more attention than others, but that doesn\'t necessarily reflect their value. Sometimes the most useful tools are the ones that solve specific problems for specific communities, even if they don\'t go viral 🎯.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="the-clean-code-reality" href="#the-clean-code-reality">\n  </a>\n  The "Clean Code" Reality\n</h3>\n\n<p>Best practices like SOLID principles are excellent guidelines, but real-world development is complex.

It\'s about finding the right balance between code quality and delivering value 🤷‍♂️.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="the-learning-journey" href="#the-learning-journey">\n  </a>\n  The Learning Journey\n</h3>\n\n<p>Learning new technologies takes time and practice. Many developers watch tutorials, read documentation, and experiment with new tools while maintaining our current projects.

To be honest, I didn’t realize it was a well-known problem because I don’t frequently visit coding practice websites. Instead, I’ve always relied on my original problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Typically, I ace take-home assignments and impress reviewers, which ultimately earns me my offers. That’s how it’s always been.</p>\n\n<p>However, during some of my job-seeking phases, I’ve encountered a different method of assessing candidates: the pairing session. I’m not opposed to it, as it gives the interviewer (the “navigator”) a chance to see the candidate(the “driver”)’s ability to verbalize their thought process while solving problems together.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fd3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fd3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png" alt=" " loading="lazy" width="800" height="457"></a></p>\n\n<p>The problem is like this: imagine a 10x10 grid with a rover starting at coordinates (5, 5)—essentially in the middle of the grid—facing east. The rover can receive commands represented by "L," "R," or "M," where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>L means to rotate left (90° counterclockwise),</li>\n<li>R means to rotate right (90° clockwise), and</li>\n<li>M means to move forward by one grid cell in its current direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example, if the command sequence is “MMMLMMM,” the rover would end up at coordinates (8, 2), facing north. The output format should look like “8:2:N”.

But which coordinate—x or y—should we adjust? That depends on the direction. If the rover is facing "E" (East) or "W" (West), the x-axis changes. If it’s facing "N" (North) or "S" (South), the y-axis changes.</p>\n\n<p>To manage direction, I thought in terms of degrees: "E" represents 0°, "N" 90°, "W" 180°, and "S" 270°. When the degrees loop back to 360°, we\'re facing "E" again. The "L" and "R" commands adjust the rover’s direction by subtracting or adding 90° to the current heading.

    body_markdown:
      '# I was horrified by AI on the eve of Halloween 💀\n\nJust days before Halloween 2024, I had a virtual interview with a potential employer, where the lead engineer presented me with the "classic Mars Rover problem." To be honest, I didn’t realize it was a well-known problem because I don’t frequently visit coding practice websites. Instead, I’ve always relied on my original problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Typically, I ace take-home assignments and impress reviewers, which ultimately earns me my offers. That’s how it’s always been.\n\nHowever, during some of my job-seeking phases, I’ve encountered a different method of assessing candidates: the pairing session. I’m not opposed to it, as it gives the interviewer (the “navigator”) a chance to see the candidate(the “driver”)’s ability to verbalize their thought process while solving problems together.\n\n\n\n\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png)\n\nThe problem is like this: imagine a 10x10 grid with a rover starting at coordinates (5, 5)—essentially in the middle of the grid—facing east. The rover can receive commands represented by "L," "R," or "M," where:\n\n- L means to rotate left (90° counterclockwise),\n- R means to rotate right (90° clockwise), and\n- M means to move forward by one grid cell in its current direction.\n\nFor example, if the command sequence is “MMMLMMM,” the rover would end up at coordinates (8, 2), facing north. The output format should look like “8:2:N”. Simple enough?\n\nSince I’ve been working with React for a couple of years, my natural approach to solving this was to think in terms of State and Effect, where the state would represent the rover’s coordinates and direction. But as this wasn’t a UI test, the interviewer encouraged me to stick to pure logical programming. I chose Node.js, my preferred backend language, to tackle the problem.\n\nMy initial setup probably looked something like this:\n\n```\nconst intialStateOfRover = {\n  x: 5,\n  y: 5,\n  direction: "E",\n};\n\nfunction processCommands(commandString) {\n  //iterate commandString in a loop and do the movement logic\n  //the movement logic results in a new state for rover\n\n  //return the state in format x:y:direction\n}\n```\n\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v4mhbx9qkylyrw4gdp2v.gif)\n\nThe command "M" is straightforward since it just requires moving one grid forward (+1). But which coordinate—x or y—should we adjust? That depends on the direction. If the rover is facing "E" (East) or "W" (West), the x-axis changes. If it’s facing "N" (North) or "S" (South), the y-axis changes.\n\nTo manage direction, I thought in terms of degrees: "E" represents 0°, "N" 90°, "W" 180°, and "S" 270°. When the degrees loop back to 360°, we\'re facing "E" again. The "L" and "R" commands adjust the rover’s direction by subtracting or adding 90° to the current heading. This approach helped me map out the logic needed for the program.\n\n```\nconst COMMANDS = {\n  L: 90,\n  R: -90,\n  M: 1,\n};\n\nconst DIRECTIONS = {\n  E: {\n    axis: "x",\n    value: 1,\n    degree: 0,\n  },\n  W: {\n    axis: "x",\n    value: -1,\n    degree: 180,\n  },\n  N: {\n    axis: "y",\n    value: -1,\n    degree: 90,\n  },\n  S: {\n    axis: "y",\n    value: 1,\n    degree: 270,\n  },\n};\n\nfunction processCommands(commandString) {\n  const resultState = { ...intialStateOfRover };\n  const lengthOfCommand = commandString.length;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < lengthOfCommand; i++) {\n    let directionObj = DIRECTIONS[resultState.direction];\n\n    const command = commandString[i];\n    if (command === "M") {\n      resultState[directionObj.axis] =\n        resultState[directionObj.axis] + directionObj.value;\n    } else {\n      let degree = directionObj.degree;\n      degree = degree + COMMANDS[command];\n\n      resultState.direction = Object.entries(DIRECTIONS).find(\n        (direction) => direction[1].degree === degree\n      )?.[0];\n    }\n  }\n\n  return `${resultState.x}:${resultState.y}:${resultState.direction}`;\n}\n```\n\nAs I explained my code to the interviewer, we took a test-driven approach to validate my logic. That’s when we hit a roadblock: running the command sequence "MMML" correctly placed the rover, but with "MMMR," the result came back as undefined.\n\nWhile debugging together, we discovered that moving clockwise caused the degree to become "-90," which wasn’t found in the DIRECTIONS map. The interviewer kindly offered a hint, introducing me to the concept of "Modulo." By adding the maximum degree to the current degree and then finding the remainder with respect to the maximum degree, we could wrap negative values around. This way, "-90" would become 270, which correctly maps to the "S" (South) direction. It worked like this...\n\n\n```\nlet degree = directionObj.degree;\ndegree = degree + COMMANDS[command];\ndegree = (degree + 360) % 360;\n```\n\nVoilà! The test for moving in the correct direction passed. It took us 30–45 minutes to complete, and I felt genuinely humbled by the experience. I thanked the interviewer for his time, and afterward, I kept reflecting on ways I could have improved my approach.

Until software products are designed exclusively for AI rather than human customers, human developers will remain essential.\n\n## For Humans, By Humans\n\n\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9af048dkik969fonbx0n.png)\n\n# HAPPY HALLOWEEN 2024 👻 !!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

      '<p>Woah, I finally have the time to write this blog that’s been on my mind recently!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>"a day in the life of a software engineer"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This phrase has changed the trajectory of my career and set me on the path to my current life. The first time I heard it was in a YouTube video that caught my attention right away. Yup, it was that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqX8PFcOpxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-minute clip</a> from Mayuko’s channel.</p>\n\n<p>I watched that video and thought, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Wow, that’s cool! I want to be a software engineer too!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back then, I was working as an IT Support Analyst, clearing the queue of tickets raised by our manufacturing operators and engineers. I worked hard, did my 12-hour shifts, and then chilled at home with "How I Met Your Mother." Life was perfectly fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But now that I think about it, the scariest thought to me, even to this day is , that could have been the rest of my life...</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7oz7fix56y83y8c4zbes.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7oz7fix56y83y8c4zbes.jpg" alt="I thought I was trying hard" loading="lazy" width="736" height="736"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="i-thought-i-was-trying-hard" href="#i-thought-i-was-trying-hard">\n  </a>\n  I thought I was trying hard\n</h2>\n\n<p>So, what happened was that after earning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018, I had already spent two years in my IT Support role, but I dared myself to start looking for opportunities. With a lot of dedication, humiliation, and embarrassment, I finally landed a software engineer position at a humble systems integration company, even though it meant a pay cut. I was a complete novice, totally new to writing code.</p>\n\n<p>Six years have passed, and along the way, I’ve worked in multiple industries, on various products, and with different teams. Reflecting on what I’ve achieved over the years, one thought popped into my head a few days ago: I still need to write a blog about the rite of passage many fellow developers have shared that motivated me in the first place. So here’s <strong>a day in the life of a software engineer</strong> from my POV.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="disclaimer-the-following-information-is-based-on-my-experiences-at-multiple-companies" href="#disclaimer-the-following-information-is-based-on-my-experiences-at-multiple-companies">\n  </a>\n  DISCLAIMER: The following information is based on my experiences at multiple companies.\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fttbvl0gest5wmluhnafm.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fttbvl0gest5wmluhnafm.jpg" alt="Morning" loading="lazy" width="800" height="167"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="the-morning" href="#the-morning">\n  </a>\n  The Morning\n</h2>\n\n<p>I usually wake up around 7am but sometimes I toss and turn in my bed for that extra few minutes. I can still hear the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZd79rJ6a7lp?si=dea6e34f6edf4f3f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleep music playlist</a> on my Spotify and with my eyes closed, think about the tasks I need to tackle today. I go through my morning routine—making my bed and switching the music to Buddhist chants to start my day. After a shower and getting dressed, I feed my cat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jiemao_theblackcattt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jie Mao</a> and play with him for awhile.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m impatient naturally so I have my own <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@m3_yevnnn/video/7421502840352312577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boiled eggs or tea eggs</a> that I\'ve prepared over the weekends. I gulp down one or two, pack my laptop bag, and commute to the office.</p>\n\n<p>Since I work hybrid, if it\'s on work-from-home day, I would straight away open my laptop to start working. The commute isn’t bad; public transport is smooth, and I usually arrive at the office around 9:45-10 AM. I see other coworkers coming in at that time too, so I’m not too late—phew!</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fuw1qxsnswdqg6b0hofgp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fuw1qxsnswdqg6b0hofgp.jpg" alt="CBD" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="the-office" href="#the-office">\n  </a>\n  The Office\n</h2>\n\n<p>My first task of the day is to read emails and check Slack, WhatsApp, Skype, or whatever communication tool the company uses. If there aren’t any major issues, great! Time to open my Kanban board.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, I’ve worked on agile scrum teams where we usually plan what to do in the next sprint on Mondays, groom the backlogs, clarify requirements, and estimate tickets—typically using Jira boards. It’s easy to track what’s done, what’s blocked, and what’s in progress.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp" alt="Scrum" loading="lazy" width="800" height="433"></a></p>\n\n<p>I usually have an item in the "In Progress" column, so I dive into that task. Depending on the item, I put in the effort to solve the problem. If things aren’t clear, I ping the Product Manager or Business Analyst and call for a quick huddle. Time flies when you’re coding, and before I know it, it’s lunchtime around 11:30 AM-12 PM.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="the-lunch" href="#the-lunch">\n  </a>\n  The Lunch\n</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes, I have lunch with my coworkers, but if most of them are remote, it’s an own-time, own-target lunch break for me. I head to the nearest food court or hawker center, listening to music while I chow down.</p>\n\n<p>After a 30-minute lunch break, whether alone or with coworkers, I take some time to wind down, play, or just chill. Offices usually have a foosball or pool table for us to enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fef3ycxukm4yjuu7z6t8q.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fef3ycxukm4yjuu7z6t8q.jpg" alt="Team" loading="lazy" width="720" height="529"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="the-standup" href="#the-standup">\n  </a>\n  The Standup\n</h2>\n\n<p>In scrum, we have a daily quick meeting called "Stand Up," where everyone shares what they did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and updates on their tickets. During this time, we also clarify details like the schema of a JSON response, styling, and technical discussions about upcoming features. Stand-ups can be quick or might extend into longer calls.</p>\n\n<p>The term "Stand Up" comes from the fact that everyone stands during the meeting to keep it short and avoid tired legs. However, after the pandemic, stand-ups transitioned to Google Meet or Zoom, leading to some folks oversharing and prolonging meetings. A person from the team, called the "Scrum Master," leads the stand-up—this could be the lead engineer, product manager, or business analyst.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7ugj4vcun6dbv2n79spx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7ugj4vcun6dbv2n79spx.jpg" alt="Kanban" loading="lazy" width="800" height="383"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="finally-the-coding" href="#finally-the-coding">\n  </a>\n  Finally, the coding\n</h2>\n\n<p>After the stand-up, it’s time to write some code. I brainstorm and aim to finish my tasks by the end of the day. I push my code to Git, and that feeling of accomplishment is fulfilling. I review my work before assigning reviewers and also provide feedback on others\' work so we can all align and improve. Once tickets are reviewed and approved, branches are merged to dev or staging, depending on urgency. Some quick bug fixes get merged straight to production to resolve issues promptly, with those fixes then synced to lower environments.</p>\n\n<p>If a feature is complete, the Quality Assurance (QA) engineer usually tests it. If the QA role is missing, I inform the product manager or business analyst about the changes, and they confirm the features. Features get launched if everything runs smoothly and no major bugs are found during testing.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="bye-office" href="#bye-office">\n  </a>\n  Bye Office!\n</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, I clock out and commute home. Sometimes, I walk around to stretch my legs or grab dinner on the way so I won’t need to cook when I get back.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg" alt="After Office" loading="lazy" width="800" height="460"></a></p>\n\n<p>6 PM to 7/7:30 PM flies by due to the commute and dinner. At home, I usually unwind by watching some series or movies. On some nights, I work on side projects, adding features and making updates. I would also paint or sing depending on my mood. Some of my paintings are <a href="https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and my karaoke covers are <a href="https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On days when I don’t feel sore or tired, I hit the nearby gym or go jogging or cycling around the neighborhood.

      'Woah, I finally have the time to write this blog that’s been on my mind recently!\n\n\n> "a day in the life of a software engineer"\n\n\nThis phrase has changed the trajectory of my career and set me on the path to my current life. The first time I heard it was in a YouTube video that caught my attention right away. Yup, it was that [4-minute clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqX8PFcOpxA) from Mayuko’s channel.\n\nI watched that video and thought, \n\n> “Wow, that’s cool! I want to be a software engineer too!”\n\n Back then, I was working as an IT Support Analyst, clearing the queue of tickets raised by our manufacturing operators and engineers. I worked hard, did my 12-hour shifts, and then chilled at home with "How I Met Your Mother." Life was perfectly fine.\n\n**But now that I think about it, the scariest thought to me, even to this day is , that could have been the rest of my life...**\n\n\n![I thought I was trying hard](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7oz7fix56y83y8c4zbes.jpg)\n\n## I thought I was trying hard\n\nSo, what happened was that after earning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018, I had already spent two years in my IT Support role, but I dared myself to start looking for opportunities. With a lot of dedication, humiliation, and embarrassment, I finally landed a software engineer position at a humble systems integration company, even though it meant a pay cut. I was a complete novice, totally new to writing code.\n\nSix years have passed, and along the way, I’ve worked in multiple industries, on various products, and with different teams. Reflecting on what I’ve achieved over the years, one thought popped into my head a few days ago: I still need to write a blog about the rite of passage many fellow developers have shared that motivated me in the first place.

I go through my morning routine—making my bed and switching the music to Buddhist chants to start my day. After a shower and getting dressed, I feed my cat [Jie Mao](https://www.instagram.com/jiemao_theblackcattt/) and play with him for awhile.\n\nI\'m impatient naturally so I have my own [boiled eggs or tea eggs](https://www.tiktok.com/@m3_yevnnn/video/7421502840352312577) that I\'ve prepared over the weekends.

The last week, we just used it for improvements and garnishing with better game experience.\n\n# **THE LESSON** 🎄\n\nAlthough we didn't win, that was not our intension in the first place. Our intension was to try out game development in action and yes, we felt it. Game development, as fun as it is when the players are playing, the sweat and tears that the developers have to put in to details to create a good game is just admirable. I got a lot of fun working on that and it helps me to grow in my day-to-day developer career also. Hope you guys like my sharing!\n\nHow about you guys also? \nHave some game development experience? \n❓❓❓❓\nPlease share in the comments below. 👇\n\nThe Github repo for the project \nhttps://github.com/m3yevn/krescent",
