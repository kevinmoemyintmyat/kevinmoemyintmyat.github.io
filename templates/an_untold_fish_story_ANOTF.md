# An Untold Fish Story - Part 1: A Nap on the Floor 🌙


The storm had swept through New Hill City like a hurricane. It had started as a gentle breeze - just a few policy changes here and there. But then the winds had picked up, and before anyone knew it, we were all caught in a full-blown storm. The storm affected everyone in different ways, but for Fish, it was devastating since the storm took his home.

I survived by staying put. My apartment was built on solid ground, with thick walls that held firm against the howling winds. I kept my head down, literally, as debris flew past my windows and the storm raged outside. When the winds howled around us, I found shelter in my sturdy little unit. While others were swept away or forced to rebuild, I clung to what I knew. It wasn't heroic, but it was safe. The storm had hindered the economy and many people were affected in their careers.

However, it had been many months since the storm and everything had become normal again. So on a boring Tuesday at the office, I had been staring at my computer screen for three hours straight, trying to organize my emails that had been piling up for weeks. I decided to clean out my junk folder - you know how it gets with all those promotional emails and spam. That's when I saw them.

I couldn't believe it. There were dozens of emails from an unknown address that had been automatically filtered to spam. But something about the timestamps caught my attention - these emails were from over a month ago. I had been so focused on work and avoiding those scam calls that had been flooding New Hill City lately that I hadn't even checked my spam folder in weeks. The phone calls had been relentless - unknown numbers, automated voices, people claiming to be from banks or government agencies. I had learned to be cautious, to let unknown numbers go to voicemail. But now I wondered - had I been ignoring something important?

**From:** fish.cadet@gmail.com
**Subject:** You won't believe where I am now, Bird

I smiled. Fish. My old friend who had lost his home in the storm and left town to explore a new country. I had watched him pack his bags, say goodbye to everyone at the research company where we'd first met working on that robotic project. But before he disappeared into the night like a character from a Bogart movie I'd never get to see the sequel to, he had called me. A personal goodbye, just the two of us, talking about old times and uncertain futures.

And now here it was, sitting in my inbox. But this wasn't just a message - it was a story. A story that would make me question everything I thought I knew about adventure, belonging, and what it meant to truly live.

I clicked on the first email and began reading. Fish had written it as a way to catch up with me, he explained, since he had been in such a rush to get Hei back home that he couldn't find time to meet in person. He had tried calling me several times, but I never picked up - probably because of all those scam calls that had been flooding the city. So he decided to write it all down instead, to share his journey with me in a way that would last longer than a phone conversation.

Fish was writing from a place called New Arrivals, across the bridge from New Hill City - a whole different country that sounded like the wilder, more experimental cousin of the polished city where Fish had spent the last twelve years.

And now, as I sat at my desk reading Fish's story, I found myself transported to another world - a world where storms could change everything, where bridges led to new beginnings, and where a fish out of water could become something extraordinary.

## Hei

As I read on, I learned about Hei. Fish's cat or should we say a catfish? The one thing that had remained constant in his life during all those years in New Hill City.

![IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Aesthetic 2D Minecraft style, Hei the cat, pixelated cat character, orange tabby cat, sitting on windowsill, looking out window, cozy home setting, warm lighting, cat waiting for owner]
*Keywords: Aesthetic 2D Minecraft style, Hei cat, pixelated cat, orange tabby, windowsill, looking out window, cozy home, warm lighting, waiting cat, pet character*

Fish wrote about how Hei would curl up beside him while he read, how he'd greet him at the door every evening with that particular meow that meant "where have you been?" How he'd sit on his lap during meditation sessions, purring softly as if he understood the silence.

But when the storm came and took Fish's home, Hei couldn't come with him. Fish had to leave him with someone - a friend who promised to take good care of him. A friend he knew from childhood - a girl named Luna who had always been good with animals. At the same time, Fish had been preparing documentations for Hei's migration.

I could feel the weight of that decision in Fish's words. The guilt. The uncertainty. The way he wrote about walking away from his ruined terrace that final morning, Hei watching from the windowsill, not understanding why his human was leaving with a suitcase.

"It's only temporary," Fish had whispered to him through the glass. But he wasn't sure if that was true.

As I read this part, I found myself thinking about all the things we leave behind when storms force us to move. The small comforts. The daily routines. The family members that depend on us. It made me grateful for my sturdy apartment, for the fact that I could stay put while others had to abandon everything they knew.

But it also made me wonder - what would I do if a storm came for me? What would I be forced to leave behind?

## Crossing the Bridge

I continued reading, learning about Fish's arrival in New Arrivals. The immigration officer had looked at Fish's passport, then at him, then back at his passport. "You're coming from New Hill City?" she asked, her accent warmer than what Fish was used to.

"Yes, ma'am," Fish said, trying to sound confident despite feeling like a refugee.

"What brings you to New Arrivals?"

Fish paused. How do you explain that you're a displaced person from a storm? "Travelling..." he said finally.

She frowned, looking at his documents again. "Travelling, huh? How long do you plan to stay?" Her tone was skeptical, her eyes scanning his papers for any inconsistencies. Unable to find any, she let him go.

*Keywords: Aesthetic 2D Minecraft style, immigration checkpoint, border crossing, pixelated office, documents checking, passport, bureaucratic setting, threshold moment, Fish character*

That was three months ago. Three months of Fish learning that sometimes the best growth happens when you're forced to start over, when you have to build bridges between worlds that don't always understand each other.

That's when Fish met the locals - the people who would teach him that sometimes the storm leads you to exactly where you need to be.

The first thing that struck Fish about this new place wasn't the humidity or the traffic - it was how lost he felt. Again. He'd been confident in New Hill City, but here he was just another fish out of water trying to figure out how to survive.

"If you don't go where you don't wanna go, but when you have to go, then you'll be dragged to it" - but where did Fish have to go? After twelve years of being a guest, he wasn't sure he knew anymore.

## An Unexpected Encounter

Fish had been looking for a place to rent in New Arrivals, something affordable that wouldn't drain what little savings he had left after the storm. The apartment complex he found was modest but clean, and the landlord seemed decent enough.

Fish was unloading his belongings from the taxi, struggling with his suitcase and a few boxes of essentials, when he heard a familiar voice behind him.

"Fish? Is that really you?"

Fish turned around and there was Niwra, standing in the doorway of the apartment next to his, looking just as surprised as Fish felt. They hadn't seen each other in years - not since before the storm, when they'd both worked on the same robotic project at a research company in New Hill City.

"Fish," Niwra said, his face breaking into a smile, "what are you doing here?"

They spent the next hour catching up, sitting on the steps outside their apartments while Fish's belongings sat unpacked in the hallway. Niwra had been living in New Arrivals for a few years already, although an original resident of Lucky City, had figured out where to find decent food that wouldn't break their limited budgets.

"By the way," Niwra said as they were wrapping up their conversation, "How's Bird also, man? It's been long time since we all worked together...Do you remember that robotic project we did at a college near the Red Bridge?"

---

As I read this part, I felt a strange warmth in my chest. Those were the days that things were simpler back then. I truly remember the genuinely happy Fish. I used to say to him, "Hey Fish, you are as happy as me. You are happy like Bird!" In my quiet apartment, surrounded by the same four walls I'd been staring at for months, it felt good to know that my existence mattered to folks out there in the world.


It wasn't mentorship - it was neighborly kindness. A local who understood the challenges of starting over in New Arrivals, who had learned the customs and could show Fish where to find decent food that wouldn't break his limited budget. Niwra even showed Fish how to get fresh water from the vending machines instead of buying expensive bottles from convenience stores - a small thing, but it made a big difference when every dollar counted.

The practical challenges were manageable. But learning to navigate cultural differences, communication styles, and social expectations - that was the real challenge for Fish. And after Fish's New Hill City experience, he thought he knew this dance. But this place was different. The rhythm was different. The steps were different.

Niwra taught Fish phrases in the local language, showed him where to find the best street food, and most importantly, they helped each other understand that being a good person isn't just about looking after yourself - it's about building bridges between people.

---

As I read this part, I found myself giggling despite the late hour. Street food? Cultural bridges? This sounded like an adventure novel, not a real life. But something about Fish's story was drawing me in, making me forget about the reports and deadlines that usually consumed my days. Fish was a very dramatic guy after all, but that's what I loved about him.

## Fish's Confessions

As I continued reading, I learned about the dream that had changed everything for Fish. One night, about three weeks into Fish's time in New Arrivals, he had a dream that would alter how he thought about his journey. In the dream, Fish was entering a temple and found someone divine. Fish confessed also that he's a lucid dreamer. I raised my eyebrows this time. Fish's getting weird now.

Fish could only describe that temple as having many red lanterns and inside there was someone who could resemble the Goddess of Compassion. She was holding a willow branch and as the people came in to visit her, her attendants would tell the visitors to leave politely. But Fish persisted that he wanted to see because of the charisma of the divine, he stayed. She smiled and invited Fish nearer and whispered "You are not lost, Fish. You are exactly where you need to be."

Fish recounted the dream as surreal and vivid, but at the same time, he was skeptical and forgot about it the next day where he had to buy a wifi for his new settlement.

![IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Aesthetic 2D Minecraft style, Fish's dream sequence, pixelated temple with red lanterns, Goddess of Compassion figure, willow branch, divine presence, ethereal lighting, mystical atmosphere, dreamlike quality]
*Keywords: Aesthetic 2D Minecraft style, dream sequence, pixelated temple, red lanterns, Goddess of Compassion, willow branch, divine presence, ethereal lighting, mystical atmosphere, dreamlike quality*
The next evening, he went to the center of the city to buy a data plan.

Fish had forgotten his passport and couldn't get the WiFi access he needed, but as soon as Fish stepped out of the shopping mall in the early evening, he was greeted with something he had never seen before. The Parade of the Gods. 

And as Fish was curious about what it was, he started seeing red lanterns that he had dreamed about the night before. But it wasn't just the lanterns - it was the specific patterns. The way they hung in clusters of three, the golden tassels swaying in the evening breeze, even the intricate dragon motifs painted on their sides. Fish felt that same magnetic pull he had experienced in his dream, that same charisma drawing him closer.

All the visions became deja vu for him - the red lanterns, the procession of people, even the way the evening light caught the decorations and cast long shadows on the colonial buildings that lined the street. Fish found himself walking along the parade with other attendees, but he wasn't just following - he was being guided by something he couldn't explain. The same divine presence he had felt in his dream seemed to be moving through the crowd, touching each person with that same gentle authority.

He had never experienced this kind of coincidence and synchronicity before. It wasn't just that the dream had predicted the parade - it was that the dream had prepared him for this moment, had shown him how to recognize the sacred in the ordinary.

The parade lasted for hours, winding through the streets of the city center. Fish followed it, mesmerized by the music, the colors, the sense of community that seemed to fill the air. By the time it ended, he felt like he had witnessed something profound.

The next day, after getting his passport carefully this time, he found a local phone shop and bought a prepaid SIM card. That evening, he called Luna, his friend who had been taking care of Hei. He told her the weird story about the dream and the parade, and she listened quietly on the other end of the line.

Luna had always been the practical one among their group of friends - the one who remembered everyone's birthdays, who knew how to fix things around the house, who could calm down any anxious pet. She had taken Hei in without hesitation when Fish had called her in a panic, promising to care for him until Fish could figure out his next steps.

"In our culture, dreams like this are considered guidance from the divine," Luna said finally, her voice warm and familiar across the distance. "Maybe she's telling you that your journey isn't just about finding work or home - it's about finding your purpose. And maybe," she added with a knowing smile that Fish could hear in her voice, "your purpose isn't about finding a place to belong, but about learning to belong wherever you are." She told him there was a big Goddess of Mercy statue on an island called "Palm Island" far north of the country.

"How's Hei?" Fish asked, his voice catching slightly.

"Oh, he's fine," Luna laughed. "He's been sleeping on my pillow every night, and he's learned to open the kitchen cabinets. He's been playing with Whiskers and Shadow - my other cats - and I think he's actually enjoying being part of the family here." She paused. "He misses you, though. Sometimes he sits by the window and just stares out, like he's waiting for you to come home."

---

I paused in my reading, struck by the mystical quality of Fish's story. In my quiet apartment, surrounded by the hum of the city outside, such dreams seemed impossible. But something about Fish's tale was making me question my own reality.

## Journey to the North

As I read on, I learned about Fish's journey towards Palm Island. After the experience with the parade and his conversation with Luna, Fish felt ready to explore more of the country. The local neighbors encouraged him to travel, including Kecik, a younger fellow countryman Fish had befriended when he arrived in New Arrivals.

Kecik was in his early twenties, a worker who had been living in New Arrivals for three years. He had the energy of youth but the wisdom of someone who had already learned to navigate cultural boundaries. He spoke the same language as Fish, making him feel less alone in a foreign land, but more than that, he understood what it felt like to be caught between two worlds.

"It's not just about seeing places," Kecik had told him over dinner one evening, his eyes bright with enthusiasm. "It's about understanding how people live, how they survive, how they find joy even when everything around them is changing. You know, Fish, when I first came here, I thought I had to choose between being who I was at home and who I needed to be here. But I've learned that you don't have to choose. You can be both. You can carry your home with you wherever you go."

Fish's first stop took him to the "History Port City". I also knew of that city with its rich history of being a port colonized by the "Sailors". Fish spent a week there, wandering through the historic districts with their rich culture and vibrant communities. 

He wrote about how the old colonial buildings stood next to modern shopping centers, how the local people had adapted to tourism while preserving their heritage. But what struck him most was the way the past and present seemed to coexist effortlessly - elderly men playing chess under the shade of ancient banyan trees while teenagers took selfies with their smartphones, traditional food vendors sharing the same street with trendy cafes, the sound of call to prayer mixing with the hum of air conditioners.

Fish spent his days exploring the narrow alleys where the air was thick with the smell of spices and incense, discovering hidden temples where locals would pause for quiet reflection. He wrote about how the city seemed to breathe with its own rhythm, slower than New Hill City but more alive somehow. One evening, he found himself walking along the famous river that cut through the heart of the city, watching the water reflect the lights of the colonial buildings and listening to the gentle lapping of waves against the stone embankments. Fish inserted a photo of himself with the iconic church in the town square - he looked different somehow, more relaxed, more curious about the world around him.

From there, Fish traveled to the capital city of the country, "Lucky City" where he found a metropolis comparable to New Hill City. But unlike New Hill City's polished efficiency, Lucky City had a chaotic charm that Fish found both overwhelming and exhilarating. Fish remembered Niwra's words: "You cannot even breathe in Lucky City, man..." - and now he understood what his friend meant, coming from someone who was an original resident of the place. 

The traffic was insane - motorcycles weaving between cars, food vendors setting up their stalls on sidewalks, the constant honking and the smell of exhaust mixing with the aroma of street food. But the people were warm despite the urban intensity, and Fish found himself drawn to the energy of the place. He wrote about how the city seemed to pulse with life, how every corner held a new surprise - a hidden mosque behind a shopping mall, a traditional market next to a modern office building, the way the city's history and future seemed to dance together in the streets.

One morning, Fish made his way to the Sacred Caves - those ancient limestone formations that rose from the earth like natural temples. He climbed the steep steps, past the colorful statues and offerings, until he reached the main cave chamber. Inside, the air was cool and the light filtered down through openings in the rock, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. Fish found a quiet spot and sat down to meditate, the same practice he had learned during those sessions at the Buddhist temple back in New Hill City.

As he sat there in the stillness, surrounded by the ancient rock formations and the gentle sound of dripping water, Fish felt a sense of peace he hadn't experienced since before the storm. But then something extraordinary happened. In the soft light that filtered through the cave openings, Fish noticed a figure carved into the rock wall - the Cosmic Dancer, frozen in eternal motion. The dancer seemed to move even in stone, one foot raised in dance, multiple arms flowing like water, surrounded by a ring of fire that seemed to flicker in the shifting light.

Fish found himself drawn to this ancient representation of divine energy. As he meditated before the Cosmic Dancer, he began to understand something profound. The dancer was both creator and destroyer, both stillness and motion, both beginning and end. In that moment, Fish realized that his own journey was like a dance - sometimes he was the dancer, sometimes he was the dance itself. The storm that had forced him to leave New Hill City wasn't just destruction; it was also creation. It was the Cosmic Dancer's way of setting him on a new path, of teaching him to flow with the rhythm of life rather than fight against it.

As Fish sat there, he felt the same sense of divine presence he had experienced in his dream with the Goddess of Compassion. But this time, it was different - this was the energy of transformation, of cosmic play, of the eternal dance between order and chaos, between staying and going, between being a guest and finding home.

One afternoon, Fish made his way to the iconic Sky Bridges - those two towering structures that seemed to touch the clouds. But as he approached, the sky darkened and rain began to fall in sheets. Fish found shelter under the canopy of a nearby building, watching as the rain transformed the towers into ethereal silhouettes against the stormy sky. The water cascaded down their glass facades like liquid silver, and Fish felt a strange sense of awe at how something so modern could look so otherworldly in the rain.

From Lucky City, Fish continued his journey north to the "Mountain City" - a place where the air was cleaner and the pace was slower. The city was built around limestone hills that rose from the earth like ancient sentinels, and Fish found himself drawn to the natural beauty that surrounded the urban center. But what struck him most was the sense of spiritual energy that seemed to permeate the place.

In the Mountain City, Fish discovered a hidden temple dedicated to the Goddess of Mercy, nestled among the limestone formations. Unlike the bustling temples of Lucky City, this place felt like a sanctuary of peace. The temple was carved into the side of a limestone hill, its entrance hidden behind a curtain of hanging vines and flowering plants. Inside, the air was cool and the light filtered through natural openings in the rock, creating an ethereal atmosphere that reminded Fish of his dream.

As Fish approached the main shrine, he felt a familiar presence - the same divine energy he had experienced in his dream, the same gentle authority that had whispered "You are not lost, Fish. You are exactly where you need to be." The statue of the Goddess of Mercy seemed to glow in the soft light, her expression serene and compassionate, her willow branch held with the same grace Fish had seen in his dream.

Fish spent hours in that temple, meditating before the Goddess of Mercy, feeling a deeper connection to the divine than he had ever experienced. It was as if the dream had been preparing him for this moment, for this place where he could finally understand the true meaning of compassion and mercy. In the stillness of that limestone temple, Fish realized that the Goddess of Mercy wasn't just guiding him to a physical destination - she was teaching him to find mercy and compassion within himself, to extend that same kindness to others, and to trust in the divine plan that was unfolding in his life.

*Keywords: Aesthetic 2D Minecraft style, Mountain City temple, Goddess of Mercy, limestone cave, pixelated spiritual, divine light, meditation, peaceful atmosphere, hidden sanctuary, spiritual connection*

From the Mountain City, Fish continued his journey to the "Gateway Town" - a bustling port city that served as the bridge between the mainland and the islands beyond. The Gateway Town was different from the other places Fish had visited. It had the energy of a place where people were always coming and going, where journeys began and ended, where the land met the sea in a constant dance of arrival and departure.

Fish spent a day exploring the Gateway Town, walking along its waterfront where fishing boats bobbed in the harbor and cargo ships loaded and unloaded their goods. The air was thick with the smell of salt and fish, and the sound of seagulls filled the sky. But what struck Fish most was the sense of anticipation that seemed to hang in the air - as if everyone in the Gateway Town was waiting for something, preparing for a journey, or returning from one.

The next morning, Fish made his way to the ferry terminal. As he stood on the dock, looking out at the water that stretched toward the horizon, he felt a strange mix of excitement and nervousness. The ferry to Palm Island was smaller than he had expected, painted in bright colors that seemed to dance in the morning light. As the ferry pulled away from the dock, Fish found himself standing at the rail, watching the Gateway Town grow smaller in the distance.

The journey across the water was peaceful, the ferry cutting through the calm sea with a gentle rhythm. Fish could see Palm Island growing larger on the horizon, its green hills rising from the water like a promise. As they approached, Fish felt a sense of anticipation building in his chest - he was finally reaching the destination that had been calling to him through dreams and divine guidance. The Goddess of Mercy was waiting for him on Palm Island, and Fish was ready to meet her.

As Fish stepped onto Palm Island, he felt a sense of completion that he hadn't experienced since before the storm. The island was beautiful - tropical vegetation, gentle hills, and a sense of peace that seemed to emanate from the very ground. But Fish's first stop wasn't the Goddess of Mercy statue. Instead, he found himself drawn to a small Buddhist temple that reminded him of home.

The temple was simple but elegant, with golden spires that caught the light and prayer flags that fluttered in the sea breeze. Inside, Fish found a statue of the Buddha that looked remarkably similar to the ones he had seen in temples back in his homeland. For the first time since leaving New Hill City, Fish felt a connection to his roots, to the spiritual traditions that had shaped him as a child. He sat in meditation for a long time, feeling the familiar peace of Buddhist practice, the same stillness he had learned in those meditation sessions at the temple in New Hill City.

Later that day, Fish found himself wandering through the "Floating Village" - a community of houses built on stilts over the water, connected by wooden walkways that seemed to float on the sea itself. The village was like nothing Fish had ever seen, a place where land and water merged seamlessly, where the rhythm of the tides became part of daily life. As he walked along the creaking wooden planks, Fish noticed a small temple at the end of one of the walkways.

The temple was dedicated to the "Monkey King" - a figure from ancient legends known for his wisdom, mischief, and ability to transform himself. The statue was intricate and detailed, showing the Monkey King in a pose of both playfulness and profound wisdom, his eyes seeming to follow Fish as he approached. Fish stood before the statue, feeling a strange connection to this legendary figure.

The Monkey King was known for his journey of transformation, for learning to balance mischief with wisdom, for understanding that sometimes you had to be clever and adaptable to survive in an ever-changing world. It reminded Fish of his own journey - the need to be flexible, to adapt to new circumstances, to find wisdom in unexpected places. Like the Monkey King, he had been forced to leave his familiar world, to navigate new territories, to learn new ways of being. The Monkey King's story was one of growth through adventure, of finding strength through transformation - themes that resonated deeply with Fish's own experience of displacement and discovery.

As he offered a silent prayer to the Monkey King, Fish felt a sense of recognition and gratitude. The legendary figure seemed to understand the challenges of being an outsider, of having to prove oneself in unfamiliar lands, of learning to thrive through adaptability and courage.

But Fish's journey wasn't complete yet. The next day, he made his way to the "Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas" - a magnificent complex that rose from the hillside like a spiritual mountain. The temple was unlike anything Fish had ever seen, with multiple levels, intricate architecture, and statues of the Buddha everywhere he looked. But at the very top, standing majestically against the sky, was the statue of the Goddess of Mercy that Luna had told him about.

As Fish climbed the steps to the temple, he felt the same divine presence he had experienced in his dream, in the parade, in the Mountain City temple. But this time, it was overwhelming - a sense of completion, of coming home to something he had been searching for all along. When he finally reached the top and stood before the massive statue of the Goddess of Mercy, Fish felt tears streaming down his face. This was it - the destination that had called to him through dreams and divine guidance, the place where his journey from displacement to belonging would finally be complete.

Fish spent the entire day at the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas, meditating before the Goddess of Mercy, feeling a sense of peace and belonging that he had never experienced before. As the sun set behind the temple, casting long shadows across the hillside, Fish realized that his journey wasn't just about finding a place to belong - it was about learning to belong wherever he was, about carrying the divine within himself, about understanding that home wasn't a place but a state of being.

The Goddess of Mercy had guided him through the storm, through displacement, through cultural adaptation, and finally to this moment of complete spiritual fulfillment. Fish's mission was complete.

It had taken him exactly seven days to complete this journey - seven days that had taken him through seven different states and covered over 700 kilometers from where he had started in New Arrivals. Seven days of discovery, seven states of transformation, and 700 kilometers of growth. The number seven had always been significant in his culture, and now he understood why - it was the perfect number for a journey of spiritual awakening.

But as Fish made his way down from the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas, his phone rang. It was a call from a recruiting firm in New Hill City - a possible job opportunity, a chance to return to the city he had called home for twelve years. The recruiter was excited about Fish's background and wanted to discuss a position that seemed perfect for his skills and experience.

Fish listened to the details, feeling a strange mix of excitement and uncertainty. Here he was, having just completed his spiritual journey, having found peace and belonging in the most unexpected places, and now he was being offered a way back to his old life. But the recruiter mentioned there would be a take-home assignment, something that would require focus and preparation.

As Fish stood there, looking out at the sea that stretched toward the horizon, he realized he needed time to process everything that had happened. His spiritual journey had been intense, transformative, and deeply meaningful. He needed a place to recuperate, to reflect on what he had learned, and to work on the assignment without the distractions of the bustling cities he had visited.

That's when Fish decided to go even farther north, to Eagle Island - a place he had heard about from other travelers, a place known for its natural beauty, peaceful atmosphere, and the kind of solitude that would allow him to think clearly and work effectively. Eagle Island would be his refuge, his place to recuperate from the intensity of his spiritual journey and prepare for the possibility of returning to New Hill City.

The next morning, Fish boarded another ferry, this one heading north to Eagle Island. As he stood on the deck, watching Palm Island grow smaller in the distance, he felt a sense of completion and anticipation. His spiritual journey was complete, but his story wasn't over yet.

During the ferry ride to Eagle Island, Fish found himself talking to a local historian who was returning home after a conference. The historian shared fascinating stories about the connections between the regions - how Eagle Island was historically connected to the "Golden Peninsula", and how there were ancient trade routes that linked Eagle Island to the "Diamond Island" across the sea. Fish learned about the cultural exchanges, the shared traditions, and the way these places had influenced each other over centuries.

The historian also told Fish about the "Visionary Leader" who had helped transform Eagle Island from a sleepy fishing village into a world-class destination. The Visionary Leader had seen the potential in Eagle Island's natural beauty and had worked to develop it while preserving its unique character. Fish was fascinated by how one person's vision could transform an entire region, how leadership could create opportunities for growth while maintaining cultural identity.

As the ferry approached Eagle Island, Fish could see the lush green hills rising from the sea, the pristine beaches, and the sense of natural beauty that had attracted the Visionary Leader's attention. This was the northernmost tip of the new country, where the land reached out into the sea like a finger pointing toward distant horizons. Beyond these waters lay the Gulf of Naga, connecting to another country entirely - a reminder that even at the edge of one world, there were always new worlds waiting to be discovered.

He felt a connection to this place that went beyond just its physical beauty - there was something about the island's history, its connections to other places, and the vision that had shaped its development that resonated with his own journey of transformation and growth. Standing here at the edge of the new country, looking out toward the Gulf of Naga, Fish understood that his journey had brought him to a place where boundaries blurred and possibilities expanded.

Throughout Fish's journey through the new country, he kept thinking about the willow branch from his dream. The willow branch is a symbol of flexibility and resilience - it bends in the wind but doesn't break. That became Fish's guiding principle for his wanderlust.

Throughout his travels, Fish mentioned he had been applying for jobs back in New Hill City so that he could return, and also he had been taking online courses. Fish wrote about the challenges of juggling all those assignments and interview preparations. But just like the willow branch, he had faith that he would not break.

When Fish finally arrived at Eagle Island, he found a small guesthouse near the main town where he could rest and work on his take-home assignment. The island was everything he had hoped for - peaceful, beautiful, and the perfect place to reflect on everything that had happened during his journey. But Fish wasn't one to stay still for long, and after a few days of working on his assignment, he decided to rent a motorbike and explore the island.

One morning, Fish set out on his motorbike toward "Cape Mangrove" - a beautiful beach area known for its pristine waters and mangrove forests. The ride started peacefully, with Fish enjoying the coastal road that wound around the island's perimeter. The sea breeze was refreshing, and the views were spectacular - turquoise waters stretching toward the horizon, lush green hills rising from the coastline.

But as Fish approached Cape Mangrove, the sky suddenly darkened. What had started as a few scattered clouds quickly became a massive storm system moving in from the Gulf of Naga. The rain came down in sheets, so heavy that Fish could barely see the road ahead. The water pounded against his spectacles, creating a blurry, distorted view of the world around him.

Fish had to slow down to a crawl, squinting through the water-covered lenses of his glasses. The rain was so intense that it felt like driving through a waterfall. His spectacles were completely covered in water droplets, and he could only see vague shapes and shadows through the blur. The road became slippery, and Fish had to focus all his concentration on staying upright and moving forward.

It was a terrifying experience - driving blind through a tropical downpour on an unfamiliar road, with visibility reduced to almost nothing. Fish later wrote that it reminded him of his entire journey - moving forward through uncertainty, navigating through storms both literal and metaphorical, relying on faith and determination when clear vision wasn't possible.

Somehow, Fish managed to reach Cape Mangrove safely, where he found shelter under a wooden pavilion overlooking the beach. As he waited for the rain to ease, he watched the storm transform the landscape - the mangroves swaying in the wind, the waves crashing against the shore, the entire scene shrouded in mist and rain. It was beautiful in its own way, a reminder that sometimes the most profound experiences come when we can't see clearly, when we have to trust the path even when we can't see where it leads.

The rain eventually stopped, and Fish was able to see Cape Mangrove in all its glory - the crystal-clear waters, the pristine white sand, the mangrove forests stretching into the distance. But he would always remember that moment of driving blind through the storm, of having to trust his instincts when his vision failed him, of learning that sometimes the most important thing isn't seeing clearly, but having the courage to keep moving forward.

As Fish stood on the beach, watching the water sparkle in the afternoon sun, he noticed a small water sports center offering jetski rentals. The idea of riding across the water, feeling the wind in his hair and the spray on his face, suddenly appealed to him. After everything he had been through - the displacement, the cultural adaptation, the spiritual journey, the rain storm - he felt like he deserved a moment of pure freedom.

Fish rented a jetski and after a quick safety briefing, he found himself speeding across the turquoise waters of Cape Mangrove. The feeling was incredible - the wind rushing past him, the water spraying up in arcs behind him, the sense of gliding effortlessly over the surface of the sea. For the first time since the storm had forced him to leave New Hill City, Fish felt completely free.

He accelerated across the bay, weaving between small islands and mangrove channels, feeling the power of the machine beneath him and the vastness of the ocean around him. The worries about job applications, the uncertainty about returning to New Hill City, the challenges of adapting to new places - all of it seemed to fade away as he focused on the simple joy of movement, of speed, of being one with the water and the wind.

Fish found himself laughing out loud as he carved wide arcs across the water, the sound of his laughter mixing with the roar of the jetski engine and the splash of the waves. This was what freedom felt like - not being bound by circumstances, not being limited by geography or culture or expectation, but simply being alive in the moment, moving forward with purpose and joy.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Fish slowed down and let the jetski drift gently on the calm waters. He sat there, breathing in the salty air, watching the mangrove forests turn into dark silhouettes against the colorful sky, feeling a deep sense of peace and contentment. This moment of freedom, this connection with the natural world, this sense of being exactly where he was meant to be - it was everything he had been searching for.

But Fish's journey wasn't over yet. After completing his take-home assignment and waiting for weeks to hear back from the recruiting firm, Fish received the disappointing news - they had decided to go with another candidate. The job opportunity in New Hill City wasn't meant to be.

But something had changed in Fish during his journey. The seven days, seven states, and 700 kilometers had brought him full circle - from displacement to discovery to determination. He had learned that sometimes the journey itself is the destination, that sometimes you have to leave home to truly understand what home means to you. Despite not getting the job offer, Fish found himself preparing for his return anyway. He was ready to go home.

Fish's first stop was to pick up Hei from Luna. The reunion was emotional - Hei purring loudly as Fish scratched behind his ears, Luna smiling as she watched them together. "He's been waiting for you," Luna said, and Fish felt a lump in his throat. Even after all this time, after all the adventures and discoveries, there was something profound about being reunited with the one constant in his life.

As Fish held Hei close, he found himself thinking about all the movies he had watched about soldiers going to war, about the emotional reunions when they finally came home to their families. He remembered "Saving Private Ryan" - how the entire mission was about bringing one man home to his family, about the lengths people would go to protect what they loved. Fish realized that in a way, his entire journey had been like that - a mission to save himself, to find his way back to what mattered most.

But it wasn't just about saving himself - it was about saving Hei too. When Fish had been forced to leave New Hill City after the storm, when he had to abandon his home and everything familiar, Hei had been the one thing he couldn't take with him. Leaving Hei behind had been one of the hardest decisions of his life, like a soldier leaving his family behind when duty called. Now, holding Hei in his arms again, Fish understood what those soldiers must have felt - the relief of finally being reunited with the one they had been fighting to return to.

"He kept looking out the window every day," Luna said softly, watching as Hei nuzzled against Fish's chest. "Especially in the evenings, when he knew you used to come home from work. He'd sit by the door and wait, then eventually give up and curl up in your old spot on the couch." Fish felt tears welling up in his eyes. Even a cat could feel the absence of someone they loved, could hold onto hope that they would return.

The mission wasn't complete until Private Hei was safely back in his arms. All the spiritual journeys, all the cultural discoveries, all the bridges built between different worlds - none of it meant anything if he couldn't bring Hei home. In that moment, Fish understood that sometimes the most important battles aren't fought on distant fields, but in the quiet moments when you hold someone you love and realize that everything you've been through was worth it, just to get back to this.

From there, Fish booked a taxi to cross the bridge back to New Hill City. As the car made its way across the bridge, Fish found himself thinking about how different this crossing felt compared to his first journey in the opposite direction. Then, he had been running away from a storm, uncertain about what lay ahead. Now, he was returning with purpose, with stories, with a deeper understanding of himself and the world.

Fish plugged in his headphones and pressed play on "Sleep on the Floor" by the Lumineers. The song's lyrics about leaving home, about sleeping on floors and finding your way, felt like they had been written specifically for his journey. As the gentle guitar and harmonica filled his ears, Fish smiled to himself. The irony wasn't lost on him - he had started this journey taking "A Nap on the Floor" in New Arrivals, and now he was ending it listening to "Sleep on the Floor" as he returned to New Hill City.

The song spoke of leaving everything behind, of sleeping on floors and starting over, of the courage it takes to walk away from the familiar. But Fish had learned something the song didn't mention - that sometimes the journey away from home is what teaches you how to truly come home. That sleeping on floors, both literally and metaphorically, isn't about being lost, but about being found.

As the taxi approached the border, Fish looked out the window at the familiar skyline of New Hill City rising in the distance. He thought about the storm that had forced him to leave, about the willow branch that had guided him, about the Monkey King and the Goddess of Mercy, about the rain on his spectacles and the freedom of the jetski. He thought about Niwra's kindness, about Luna's care for Hei, about all the bridges he had built between different worlds.

Most of all, he thought about the nap he had taken on that floor in New Arrivals - that simple moment of rest that had marked the beginning of everything. Sometimes the most profound journeys start with the most humble beginnings. Sometimes you have to sleep on the floor to learn how to fly.

Fish closed his eyes and let the music carry him home, knowing that this wasn't the end of his story, but just another beginning. The bridge stretched ahead, connecting past to future, displacement to belonging, the nap on the floor to whatever dreams awaited him next.

---

I looked up from the screen, realizing I had been reading for hours. The apartment was quiet around me, and the city lights were the only illumination outside my window. Fish's emails had taken me on a journey I never expected - from the devastation of the storm to the mystical experience of the parade, from the kindness of strangers to the wisdom of ancient symbols.

There were more emails in the spam folder, but I decided to save them for tomorrow. Fish's story wasn't over yet, and somehow I knew there would be more chapters to this tale of displacement, discovery, and the search for belonging.

As I prepared for bed, I found myself thinking about the willow branch. About how sometimes the most important thing isn't finding a permanent place to call home, but learning to bend without breaking, to adapt without losing yourself, to find connection wherever you are.

Maybe that was the real lesson in Fish's story - not just for him, but for all of us who find ourselves navigating the storms of life, looking for solid ground in an uncertain world.

*"If you don't go where you don't wanna go, when you have to go, then you'll be dragged to it eventually"* - but maybe the point isn't about reaching a specific destination. Maybe it's about being willing to go, to move, to adapt, to sleep on floors when necessary, and to find home wherever you are.

The world is vast and full of opportunities for those brave enough to explore it. But the most important skill isn't technical - it's the ability to build bridges between different cultures, different perspectives, and different ways of thinking.

That's the real art of being human. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes life worth living.

But as I lay in bed that night, my phone buzzed with a new email notification. The sender address made me sit up straight: fish.pirate@gmail.com. The subject line was simple but intriguing: "Part 2: Which Jack You Wanna Be?"

As I read those words, a chill ran down my spine. I suddenly remembered all those missed calls from unknown numbers over the past month, the ones I had ignored because of the scam calls flooding the city. I had been so careful, so cautious, letting every unknown number go to voicemail. But now I realized - some of those calls might have been Fish trying to reach me, trying to share his story in real time, trying to reconnect with his old friend.

I felt a pang of guilt as I thought about all the times I had seen his number flash on my screen and let it go to voicemail, assuming it was just another scam call. Fish had been trying to reach me, and I had been too paranoid to answer. But maybe that was for the best - maybe his story was meant to be told this way, through emails that could be savored and reread, rather than hurried phone conversations.

I hesitated for a moment, then opened the email. The first line read: "Bird, happy new year! Have you forgetten our new year?"
