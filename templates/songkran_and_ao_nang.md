# An Untold Fish Story - Part 2: My Name is Jack 🏴‍☠️

> "Bird, happy new year! Have you forgotten our new year?"

**From:** fish.pirate@gmail.com  
**Subject:** Part 2: Which Jack You Wanna Be?

I stared at the email, the words hitting me like a splash of cold water. Fish. My old friend who had disappeared into the night like a character from a Bogart movie I'd never get to see the sequel to. But here he was again, writing from a new email address - fish.pirate@gmail.com - with a subject line that made me sit up straight: "Part 2: Which Jack You Wanna Be?"

I clicked on the email and began reading, not knowing that this would be the story that would change everything I thought I knew about identity, choice, and what it means to truly be free.

## The Festival That Changed Everything

Fish's story began where his previous journey had ended - still in New Arrivals, but everything had changed. He had completed his spiritual odyssey across the seven states, 700 kilometers of discovery, but he wasn't the same person who had left New Hill City. The storm that had forced him out, the bridges he had crossed, the temples he had visited, the Monkey King and the Goddess of Mercy - all of it had transformed him into someone new.

But now, as he prepared to return to New Hill City with Hei, Fish found himself facing a question he had never considered before: Who was he really? And more importantly, who did he want to be?

It was during the "Moving On" festival in the Gulf of Naga that Fish first encountered the question that would haunt him for months to come. He had traveled to Crab's Town, thinking he would focus on some personal projects while exploring the country. But the "Moving On" festival had other plans for him.

The "Moving On" festival, the Gulf of Naga's water celebration, happens every April. It's a time when the entire country comes together to celebrate renewal, to wash away the old year, and to welcome the new one with joy and laughter. For three days, the streets become rivers of water, and strangers become friends as they splash each other with buckets, water guns, and pure, cleansing joy.

Fish couldn't help but think of home - The Motherland, where they had a similar festival that celebrated the same spirit of renewal and cleansing. Though the traditions were different, the essence was the same: water washing away the old, making way for the new, bringing people together in celebration and joy.

On the first day of the "Moving On" festival, Fish found himself in the middle of Crab's Town's main street, completely soaked, laughing harder than he had in months. A group of locals had invited him to join their celebration, and as they splashed each other with water, they also shared stories about their lives, their challenges, and their dreams.

But it was during one of these conversations that a local fisherman named Captain asked Fish a question that would change everything:

"So, Fish," Captain said, his eyes twinkling with mischief as he filled his water gun, "you've been talking about your journey, about finding yourself, about becoming someone new. But I have to ask - which Jack do you wanna be?"

Fish paused, water dripping from his hair. "What do you mean?"

Captain laughed, splashing Fish with a bucket of water. "You know - Captain Jack Sparrow or Jack Dawson? The pirate or the artist? The one who survives through wit and trickery, or the one who lives with passion and sincerity - the one who died for love?"

## The Two Jacks

As Fish stood there in the middle of the water festival, soaked to the bone and surrounded by laughter, he realized that Captain had hit upon something profound. Throughout his journey, he had been trying to figure out who he was, but he had never considered the deeper question: Who did he want to be?

**Captain Jack Sparrow** - the witty, cunning pirate who thrived on chaos and trickery. The one who survived through wit and charm rather than brute force. The one who was free-spirited, unpredictable, and always seemed to escape death. The one who represented absolute independence and a refusal to be bound by rules.

**Jack Dawson** - the poor artist who lived life fully, seized the moment, and believed in love transcending all barriers. The one who was kind, adventurous, and full of life. The one who sacrificed himself for love and was remembered through memories. The one who represented sincerity, passion, and optimism.

Both were adventurers. Both were free-spirited. Both lived life on their own terms. But they approached freedom in completely different ways.

As Fish splashed and laughed with his new friends, he found himself thinking about this question more deeply than he had ever considered before. The water seemed to wash away the barriers between them, creating a space where they could be honest about their struggles and celebrate their successes. It reminded him of the festivals back in The Motherland, where water had always been a symbol of renewal and connection - where countrymen would come together to celebrate, to cleanse, and to move forward as one.

## The Monkey and the Crab

As Fish reflected on this question during his time in Crab's Town, he found himself drawn to the local legends about the monkey and the crab - two animals that represented different approaches to problem-solving.

Crab's Town has a rich history that's deeply connected to its natural environment. The town was officially established in 1872, and its name comes from the local word for "sword," which refers to the distinctive limestone karst formations that rise dramatically from the sea.

But what fascinated Fish most were the local legends about the monkey and the crab. According to local folklore, these animals represent different approaches to problem-solving. The monkey is agile and quick, able to adapt to changing circumstances with speed and flexibility. The crab is patient and methodical, moving sideways when the direct path is blocked, always finding a way forward.

Fish began to see the connection. Captain Jack Sparrow was like the monkey - he could quickly adapt to new situations, pivot when circumstances changed, and find creative solutions through wit and trickery. Jack Dawson was like the crab - he took a more methodical approach to life, building solid foundations of love and friendship, thinking through the consequences of his actions, and ensuring that his relationships would stand the test of time.

The best people, Fish realized, need both qualities. They need the agility to respond quickly to changing circumstances and the patience to build relationships and values that will last.

## The Giant Crab Statue

One of Crab's Town's most iconic landmarks is the giant crab statue that stands on the banks of the Crab River. It's a massive, colorful sculpture that serves as a symbol of the town's connection to the sea and its fishing heritage.

But to Fish, the crab statue became a symbol of something else - the importance of having a clear, visible symbol of your values and mission. Just as the crab statue reminds everyone in Crab's Town of their connection to the sea, good people need symbols and rituals that remind them of their shared purpose and values.

During his time in Crab's Town, Fish spent time with the local fishing community, learning about their traditions and way of life. He discovered how they tracked weather patterns, found the best fishing spots, and connected with other fishermen in the area. But what made this experience special wasn't just the practical knowledge - it was how the community used the crab statue as a symbol of their commitment to preserving their way of life.

Every time they faced difficult challenges, whether from storms or changing conditions, they would remind themselves of the crab statue and what it represented. They weren't just fishing - they were preserving and supporting a way of life that had been passed down through generations.

## The Water Festival Principle

As the "Moving On" festival came to an end, Fish found himself reflecting on what he had learned. The water celebration had taught him something crucial about identity: the importance of creating moments of renewal and celebration.

In life, we often focus on the challenges - the storms, the displacement, the uncertainty. But the "Moving On" festival reminded Fish that we also need moments of joy, of connection, of celebration. We need to take time to wash away the stress and frustration of difficult experiences, to renew our energy and enthusiasm, and to reconnect with the people we care about.

This became what Fish called the Water Festival Principle: the idea that good people know how to create moments of celebration and renewal, even in the midst of challenging times. They understand that they need time to play, to laugh, to connect with others as human beings, not just as colleagues or acquaintances.

## The Heart That Goes On

But it was during a conversation with an old fisherman named Salty that Fish encountered the deepest question of all. Salty was telling Fish about his wife, who had passed away the year before, and how he still felt her presence in everything he did.

"She's not gone," Salty said, looking out at the sea. "She's still here, in my heart. Every time I catch a fish, every time I see the sunset, every time I hear the waves - she's there. My heart will go on, carrying her with me."

Fish thought about Jack Dawson's famous line from Titanic: "I'm the king of the world!" But more than that, he thought about how Jack's love for Rose had transcended death, how it had given her the strength to live a full life, how it had become part of who she was.

"My Heart Will Go On" wasn't just about romantic love - it was about any love that transcends time and death. It was about carrying the people we've lost within us, about keeping their memory alive through how we live our lives, about finding strength in the connections that death cannot break.

## The Choice

As Fish prepared to leave the Gulf of Naga, he realized that Captain's question had been more than just a playful reference to two famous movie characters. It had been a profound inquiry into the nature of identity and choice.

Which Jack did he want to be? The pirate who survived through wit and trickery, or the artist who lived with passion and sincerity? The monkey who adapted quickly to changing circumstances, or the crab who built solid foundations for lasting relationships?

The answer, Fish realized, was both. The best people are like the water that connects us all - they can be fluid and adaptable when circumstances require it, but they can also be deep and steady when it comes to the things that matter most.

They can be Captain Jack Sparrow when they need to survive and adapt, but they can also be Jack Dawson when they need to love and sacrifice. They can be the monkey when they need to pivot and change, but they can also be the crab when they need to build something that will last.

## The Journey Continues

As Fish wrote this email to me, he was preparing to return to New Hill City with Hei, but he was a different person than the one who had left. He had learned that identity isn't something you find - it's something you choose, moment by moment, day by day.

He had learned that the best people are like the water that flows through the "Moving On" festival - they can be gentle and cleansing, or powerful and transformative, depending on what the moment requires. They can be the monkey or the crab, Captain Jack or Jack Dawson, depending on what the situation demands.

But most importantly, he had learned that the heart will go on - carrying with it the memories of those we've loved, the lessons we've learned, and the connections that death cannot break.

## The Deeper Question

As I finished reading Fish's email, I found myself staring at my computer screen, thinking about the question that had haunted him throughout his journey: Which Jack do you wanna be?

It's not just a question about movie characters or personality types. It's a question about how we choose to live our lives, about what values we choose to embody, about how we choose to respond to the challenges and opportunities that come our way.

Do we want to be the pirate who survives through wit and trickery, or the artist who lives with passion and sincerity? Do we want to be the monkey who adapts quickly to changing circumstances, or the crab who builds solid foundations for lasting relationships?

The answer, I realized, is that we don't have to choose. The best people are like the water that connects us all - they can be fluid and adaptable when circumstances require it, but they can also be deep and steady when it comes to the things that matter most.

They can be Captain Jack Sparrow when they need to survive and adapt, but they can also be Jack Dawson when they need to love and sacrifice. They can be the monkey when they need to pivot and change, but they can also be the crab when they need to build something that will last.

## The Heart That Goes On

As I prepared to respond to Fish's email, I found myself thinking about all the people I've loved and lost, all the connections that death cannot break, all the memories that live on in my heart. I thought about our shared heritage from The Motherland, about the festivals we had both experienced growing up, about the water that had always connected us as countrymen.

Fish's story had taught me that identity isn't something you find - it's something you choose, moment by moment, day by day. It's about deciding which Jack you want to be in each situation, about balancing the monkey and the crab within yourself, about finding the right mix of Captain Jack's wit and Jack Dawson's sincerity.

But most importantly, it had taught me that the heart will go on - carrying with it the memories of those we've loved, the lessons we've learned, and the connections that death cannot break.

The water that connects us all flows through every relationship, every moment of connection, every experience of love and loss. And just like the "Moving On" festival, it has the power to wash away barriers, create connections, and renew our spirits for the challenges ahead.

So which Jack do you wanna be? The answer, I realized, is that you don't have to choose. You can be both. You can be the water that connects us all - fluid and adaptable when circumstances require it, but deep and steady when it comes to the things that matter most.

The heart will go on, carrying with it all the Jacks we've been, all the Jacks we are, and all the Jacks we're becoming. And that, I realized, is the real art of being human.
