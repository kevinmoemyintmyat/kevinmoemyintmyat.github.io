I woke up fresh and felt ready to start the day. I already packed my luggage and my backpack. I went to the nearby restaurant to have a soup for my breakfast to soothe my hunger. The train ride to the airport takes a while and I might have taken a nap on the train when I reached the airport. <br data-v-6505da12><br data-v-6505da12> The airport was crowded with lots of travelers and arriving tourists. I checked-in at the kiosk near the flight counter. Everything was smooth and after I checked-in, I roamed around the mall near the airport to spend my time before the departure time of the airplane. <br data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-card" data-v-6505da12><img src="'+u+'" class="blog-img" alt="Selfie around Jewel Changi Airport" data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-6505da12>Selfie around Jewel Changi Airport</span></span></p><p class="mt-10" data-v-6505da12> It took around 3 hours to arrive from Singapore to Bali Ngurah Rai Airport. It was marvellous and I was super excited to land on the Bali island for the first time. You know what, I was listening to Beach vibe songs and hyping myself for this experience. The Damperser airport is clean, also crowded with tourists, and have lots of local people to help out the tourist. <br data-v-6505da12><br data-v-6505da12> First, I went to a booth to buy a SIM card. The salesperson there asked me how many days am I going to stay in Bali and provided me a SIM card to suit my needs. To describe the Damperser airport, it is decorated with ancient Balinese architecture. The gate looks pretty amazing and it made me take a selfie there. <br data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-card" data-v-6505da12><img src="'+f+'" class="blog-img" alt="Ngurah Rai Airport is decorated with ancient Balinese architecture." data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-6505da12>Ngurah Rai Airport is decorated with ancient Balinese architecture.</span></span></p><p class="mt-10" data-v-6505da12> It&#39;s already late when I arrived in Bali, around 7-8 PM. I booked a Grab taxi and went to my hotel which is in Kuta. To be exact, it&#39;s near Jalan Kartika Plaza. The ride from the airport to my hotel is breathtaking. The new scenary makes me feel deeply relaxed and I had a good chat with the taxi driver. He told me there is a G20 Summit happening in Bali at that time and that&#39;s why there are lots of travellers. <br data-v-6505da12><br data-v-6505da12> The ride was swift because I already did my research back home that the hotel would be near the airport. I checked-in at the hotel which was also easy and simple. The hotel staffs helped me bring to the room which is spacious for a single person and the services were awesome. After I&#39;ve unpacked my stuffs and laptops, I listened to some music and take a nap.... </p><p class="mt-10" data-v-6505da12> I woke up again after resting for awhile and beating the jetlag. Since I&#39;m on a tight schedule and it&#39;s just a 3-day-2-night vacation, I quickly wrote a travel plan on a note that was given at the hotel room. I googled and listed down some of the great tourist attractions that I can visit in Bali. It was like this. </p>',6),j={class:"list-disc pl-10 pt-10 text-xl font-bold"},K=r('<p class="pt-10" data-v-6505da12> After listing down my travel plan, I walked out of the resort to start roaming around the night of Jalan Kartika Plaza. Just right out of my hotel, there were many shops, bars and tattoo parlours. It is truly amazing to see the colorful actions of tourism on this road. I walked for few steps and there were friendly local people started saying &quot;Hello&quot; to me. <br data-v-6505da12><br data-v-6505da12> They asked me where I&#39;m from, gave me a bracelet which is made out of cloth said to be worn by the locals and made a chit-chat with me. Like I&#39;ve expected, the people turns out to be a group of friends who started local businesses like motorbike rental and tattoo studio. Due to their delightful gesture and fun-loving culture, I was hooked and rent a motorbike from them as well as schedule a tattoo session for the next day. <br data-v-6505da12><br data-v-6505da12> I rode the bike through the insanely crowded Jalan Kuta traffic and reached Kuta beach. The thrill was amazing and truly stimulating at the same time. I had a great look at the beach, breathed the sea breeze and rested for awhile. After I have my satisfying ride, I was a bit hungry and I saw a street store selling Satays. I bought a packet of satay to bring back to the hotel and enjoyed for myself. They only costs around a few rupiahs. <span class="blog-img-card-row" data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-card" data-v-6505da12><img src="'+b+'" class="blog-img" alt="Pretty satisfying ride around Kuta beach 🏍️" data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-6505da12>Pretty satisfying ride around Kuta beach 🏍️</span></span><span class="blog-img-card" data-v-6505da12><img src="'+y+'" class="blog-img" alt="Satay is so tender and meaty 🍢" data-v-6505da12><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-6505da12>Satay is so tender and meaty 🍢</span></span></span></p>',1),L={class:"pt-10",ref:"seminyakBeach"},x=r('<h2 data-v-6505da12>Next morning to the Seminyak beach</h2><p data-v-6505da12> After a night of sound sleep, I woke up to the wonderful sounds of singing birds around the hotel. Around the hotel, I saw lots of statues resembling the tiny gods of the island and a Garuda statue too (Garuda which is an icon of Indonesia and an emblem as well). I prepared for swimming because I just needed that vitamin-sea by now. I swam in the Pantai Jerman which is the beach just right infront of the resort. The resort itself has its own swimming pool and a bar in the middle of the swimming pool which is amazing. <br data-v-6505da12><br data-v-6505da12> I&#39;ve had myself a Bintang beer and soaked myself in that swimming pool before taking a shower and prepared to start my vacation day. First off, I went on a long motorbike ride along the Kuta beach, go up to Legian beach, up until Seminyak beach. Here we can see the difference between Kuta beach and Seminyak. Seminyak mostly have more of beach enjoyers, surfers and ministores along the beaches. I can see lots of sunbeds and small chairs given by the respective stores for the tourist to relax and chill. I had some coconut water for myself to cool down from the heat of the sun. <br data-v-6505da12><video controls data-v-6505da12><source src="'+w+'" type="video/mp4" data-v-6505da12></video><br data-v-6505da12> I spent most of the day roaming around the west coast of the Southern Bali, eating local foods like Babi Guling and Nasi Campur. And while the sun is setting, I came back to the resort and prepared for the tattoo session which is scheduled at 9pm. The tattoo studio is truly professional and went through all the great steps of printing the stencil of my design, measuring the area that is going to be inked and working on the size. The price was also pretty affordable and I also asked for a quicker session because I have the plan to see the nightlife of Bali at Legian street.
