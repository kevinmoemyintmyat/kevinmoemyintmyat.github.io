  Chart Your Course
</h2>

<p>Here's something that might surprise you about becoming a great developer: you have to learn to navigate.</p>

<p>Not just through code, but through teams, through projects, through the ever-changing waves of technology. The best developers I know aren't just coders - they're captains who can guide their crew through any storm.</p>

<p>Look at the projects you admire. The ones that sailed smoothly from idea to deployment. The ones that weathered every challenge and came out stronger. Start there. Study their navigation patterns. Learn from their leadership approaches. Understand how they kept their team motivated and on course.</p>

<p>The best developers I know are the best navigators. They have maps of successful projects, compasses pointing to best practices, and logs filled with lessons learned from every voyage.</p>

<p>I learned this from hearing my father navigate the real seas. He'd come home with stories about coordinating with crews from different countries, managing officers who spoke different languages, and dealing with the constant challenge of timezone changes as ships crossed international waters. The parallels to leading remote development teams are uncanny - you're still coordinating people who might never meet face-to-face, managing different communication styles, and working across time zones that seem to stretch endlessly.</p>

<p>This isn't just coding. This is how leadership works. 🧭</p>

  Don't Wait Until You Know Every Port
</h2>

<p>Here's a gentle truth: you don't need to know every technology to be a great captain. You just need to know how to navigate.</p>

<p>The thing is, you won't know your leadership style until you start guiding others. You won't discover your strengths until you've weathered a few different storms.</p>

<p>I've seen developers get stuck trying to master every technology before leading a project. They spend months studying every framework, every design pattern, every architecture approach. Meanwhile, other developers are leading teams, learning from their mistakes, and getting better every day.</p>

<p>I remember leading a couple of projects where I had to coordinate with developers across multiple time zones. The morning standup for one team was the evening wind-down for another. It felt like we were constantly chasing the sun around the world, just like my father used to describe navigating across international waters.</p>

<p>Start with someone else's leadership approach. Learn from it. Adapt it to your style. Then try another captain's methods. Keep going until you can't tell whose techniques you've borrowed anymore.</p>

<p>That's when you'll find your unique leadership voice. ⚓</p>

  Lead the Team You Want to Be Part Of
</h2>

<p>The best way to discover what kind of leader you want to be is simply to start leading.</p>

<p>Instead of asking "What should I build?" try asking "What kind of team do I wish I was part of?"</p>

<p>Look at the teams you've been on. The ones that felt a little frustrating. The ones that made you think "there has to be a better way to work together." That's often your best starting point.</p>

<p>I know developers who spend years studying every management theory, every team structure, every communication pattern. They never lead anything because they're waiting for the perfect leadership opportunity to come along.</p>

<p>Some of my closest friends are actual sailors, and they've taught me that the best captains aren't the ones who know every port - they're the ones who can adapt to any situation, communicate clearly with their crew, and make decisions under pressure. The same principles apply when you're leading a development team through a critical bug fix at 2 AM.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other developers are leading imperfect, sometimes chaotic teams. And they're learning. And they're getting better. And eventually, they're building amazing teams.</p>

<p>Start with what you know. Start with what you've experienced. Start with what slightly frustrates you about team dynamics.</p>

<p>The rest will naturally follow. 👥</p>

<p>Here's something that gets lost in the romanticized version of captaincy - every captain was once a cadet. Every Software Captain started somewhere, doing the hard, often thankless work that builds the foundation of their expertise. 🎓⚓ Every aspiring Software Captain begins as a cadet - writing their first "Hello World," debugging their first infinite loop, and learning that the code that works on their machine mysteriously breaks in production. </p>

<p>After the initial training, Software Captains progress through roles that involve a lot of "manual labor" - cleaning up legacy code, debugging mysterious production issues, writing tests, and creating documentation.

  Navigating the Digital Seas 🌊
</h2>

<p>Every Software Captain will face storms, icebergs, and pirates on their journey. Here's how the best captains navigate these treacherous waters: ⛈️⚓ Every captain faces the storm of technical debt - that accumulated code that slows down your ship like barnacles on a hull. Legacy systems are like icebergs hidden beneath the surface, waiting to sink your carefully planned features. </p>

<p>🧊 In the digital seas, pirates come in many forms - competitors launching similar features, market pressure to ship faster, or AI features that promise to replace your entire crew. These pirates want to steal your cargo (features) and sink your ship (product). 🤖🏴‍☠️ Your crew is everything. A captain is nothing without skilled crews who can handle the rigging (frontend), navigate the engine room (backend), and keep the ship running smoothly (DevOps). </p>

<p>When the storms are raging and the pirates are closing in, your compass is what keeps you on course. In software development, this is your team's values, your coding principles, your commitment to quality. The best captains have a strong moral compass. They don't compromise on security just to ship faster. They don't cut corners that could sink the ship later. They make decisions based on what's right for the long-term health of their crew and their cargo. ⚓</p>

  Finding Tortuga: The Captain's Haven 🏴‍☠️
</h2>

<p>Every Software Captain needs a Tortuga - a place where captains gather to rest, refuel, and share their war stories. In the digital seas, Tortuga isn't a physical island, but a community of fellow captains who understand the weight of command. 🏴‍☠️🍺 Tortuga exists in many forms: GitHub where captains showcase their ships and share code treasures, Dev.to where captains share their voyages and battles with bugs, Stack Overflow where captains go when their ship is taking on water, Discord/Slack communities where captains gather in smaller groups, and conferences where captains from all over the digital seas gather to share discoveries. Every Software Captain who enters Tortuga follows an unwritten code: share your knowledge, help new captains, tell your war stories, respect your crew, and buy the next round by sharing your expertise in return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>⚓ Building Your Advisory Crew</strong></p>

<p>As you progress from Captain to Admiral (CTO), your Tortuga evolves into something more strategic - your Advisory Crew. This isn't just about community anymore; it's about building relationships with mentors, investors, and peer CTOs who can guide your strategic decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Your Advisory Crew Should Include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Technical Mentors:</strong> Senior engineers who've scaled systems before</li>
<li>
<strong>Business Advisors:</strong> Product leaders who understand tech-business alignment</li>
<li>
<strong>Peer CTOs:</strong> Fellow captains navigating similar challenges</li>
<li>
<strong>Industry Veterans:</strong> Leaders who've weathered economic storms</li>
<li>
<strong>Investor Relations:</strong> Board members and stakeholders who need tech updates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regular Advisory Sessions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Monthly 1:1s with key advisors</li>
<li>Quarterly strategic review meetings</li>
<li>Annual advisory board sessions</li>
<li>Crisis consultation protocols</li>
</ul>

  Balancing Hands-On Work vs Leadership ⚖️
</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges every Software Captain faces is knowing when to step back from coding and focus on leading. Here's the reality: ⚓👥</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>🎯 The Leadership Transition Matrix</strong></p>

<p><strong>Software Captain (70% hands-on, 30% leadership):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Still writing code daily</li>
<li>Leading by example in technical decisions</li>
<li>Mentoring 2-3 team members</li>
<li>Making architecture choices for the team</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lead Engineer (50% hands-on, 50% leadership):</strong></p>

<li>Coding 3-4 days per week</li>
<li>Leading technical direction across teams</li>

  The Captain's True Compass 🧭
</h2>

<p>Now, here's something most captains never learn - there's a difference between knowing where you are and knowing where you want to go. ✨🗺️</p>

<p>You see, every captain has a compass. Most think it points north, but that's not how the real ones work. The compass that matters doesn't point to true north - it points to what you desire most in the world.</p>

<p>For some captains, it points to treasure - the next big promotion, the perfect architecture, the flawless codebase. For others, it points to a person - maybe a mentor who inspired them, or a team member they're trying to help grow. For still others, it points to a place - that mythical "perfect project" where everything just works.</p>

<p>The thing is, your compass changes. What you wanted when you first set sail isn't necessarily what you want now. And that's not a bad thing - it means you're growing, learning, becoming the captain you were meant to be.</p>

<p>But here's the secret that Jack never tells anyone - the compass only works when you're honest with yourself about what you truly want. You can't fool it with what you think you should want, or what others expect you to want. It only points to what your heart truly desires.</p>

<p>So ask yourself, Software Captain - what does your compass point to? Is it pointing to the right thing? Are you sailing toward what you truly want, or are you just following the winds of other people's expectations?</p>

<p>Because here's the thing about being a captain - you get to choose your destination. You get to decide what treasure is worth pursuing, what port is worth sailing to, what adventure is worth the risk. 🗺️</p>

<p>The seas will always be rough. The pirates will always be out there. The storms will always come. But if you know what your compass truly points to, if you're honest about what you desire most in this world, then you'll always know which way to sail.</p>

<p>And maybe that's the real lesson here - not how to be a perfect Software Captain, but how to be the captain who knows where they're going and why they're going there.</p>

`,body_markdown:`> For my father, the greatest sailor of all time, not only in the sea, but in his life as well.

## Chart Your Course

Here's something that might surprise you about becoming a great developer: you have to learn to navigate.

Not just through code, but through teams, through projects, through the ever-changing waves of technology. The best developers I know aren't just coders - they're captains who can guide their crew through any storm.

Look at the projects you admire. The ones that sailed smoothly from idea to deployment. The ones that weathered every challenge and came out stronger. Start there. Study their navigation patterns. Learn from their leadership approaches. Understand how they kept their team motivated and on course.

The best developers I know are the best navigators. They have maps of successful projects, compasses pointing to best practices, and logs filled with lessons learned from every voyage.

I learned this from hearing my father navigate the real seas. He'd come home with stories about coordinating with crews from different countries, managing officers who spoke different languages, and dealing with the constant challenge of timezone changes as ships crossed international waters. The parallels to leading remote development teams are uncanny - you're still coordinating people who might never meet face-to-face, managing different communication styles, and working across time zones that seem to stretch endlessly.

This isn't just coding. This is how leadership works. 🧭

## Don't Wait Until You Know Every Port

Here's a gentle truth: you don't need to know every technology to be a great captain. You just need to know how to navigate.

The thing is, you won't know your leadership style until you start guiding others. You won't discover your strengths until you've weathered a few different storms.

I've seen developers get stuck trying to master every technology before leading a project. They spend months studying every framework, every design pattern, every architecture approach. Meanwhile, other developers are leading teams, learning from their mistakes, and getting better every day.

I remember leading a couple of projects where I had to coordinate with developers across multiple time zones. The morning standup for one team was the evening wind-down for another. It felt like we were constantly chasing the sun around the world, just like my father used to describe navigating across international waters.

Start with someone else's leadership approach. Learn from it. Adapt it to your style. Then try another captain's methods. Keep going until you can't tell whose techniques you've borrowed anymore.

That's when you'll find your unique leadership voice. ⚓

![A software captain learning to navigate different USB ports and digital harbors](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3usj9z9krx0zr6qk1lc3.png)

## Lead the Team You Want to Be Part Of

The best way to discover what kind of leader you want to be is simply to start leading.

Instead of asking "What should I build?" try asking "What kind of team do I wish I was part of?"

Look at the teams you've been on. The ones that felt a little frustrating. The ones that made you think "there has to be a better way to work together." That's often your best starting point.

I know developers who spend years studying every management theory, every team structure, every communication pattern. They never lead anything because they're waiting for the perfect leadership opportunity to come along.

Some of my closest friends are actual sailors, and they've taught me that the best captains aren't the ones who know every port - they're the ones who can adapt to any situation, communicate clearly with their crew, and make decisions under pressure. The same principles apply when you're leading a development team through a critical bug fix at 2 AM.

Meanwhile, other developers are leading imperfect, sometimes chaotic teams. And they're learning. And they're getting better. And eventually, they're building amazing teams.

Start with what you know. Start with what you've experienced. Start with what slightly frustrates you about team dynamics.

The rest will naturally follow. 👥

Because here's the thing about being a captain - you get to choose your destination. You get to decide what treasure is worth pursuing, what port is worth sailing to, what adventure is worth the risk. 🗺️

The seas will always be rough. The pirates will always be out there. The storms will always come. But if you know what your compass truly points to, if you're honest about what you desire most in this world, then you'll always know which way to sail.

And maybe that's the real lesson here - not how to be a perfect Software Captain, but how to be the captain who knows where they're going and why they're going there.

<p>There are many talented developers out there, and it's inspiring to see our achievements! Looking at LinkedIn profiles and social media posts, you'll find developers with impressive badges, certifications, and contributions that showcase our dedication to the craft. Many have earned that coveted "Senior" title through hard work and experience. We write clean, maintainable code, follow best practices like SOLID principles, and craft commit messages that tell the story of our work 📝.</p>

<p>These developers often have structured routines - maybe we start our day early and then dive into our work with focus. We check our notifications, review pull requests thoughtfully, and write code with care. We're the kind of developers who read documentation thoroughly and ask thoughtful questions. We write comprehensive unit tests and consider edge cases that others might miss 🧪.</p>

<p>Our code reviews are thorough and constructive. We spot potential issues early, suggest helpful optimizations, and ensure proper error handling. Our colleagues appreciate our expertise and often turn to us for guidance. We're constantly learning and growing, staying up-to-date with industry trends and experimenting with new technologies 🚀.</p>

  Stress is the killer of joy from coding 😰
</h2>

<p>But here's what many developers don't talk about openly – the pressure can be overwhelming. The tech industry moves incredibly fast, and keeping up while maintaining quality work, mentoring others, and having a life outside of work can feel impossible 😮‍💨.</p>

<p>Every time a new framework or tool gains popularity, there's this nagging feeling of falling behind. The stress shows up in different ways - maybe we wake up in the middle of the night thinking about a bug we might have missed, or we probably dream about work problems. Sometimes we find ourselves checking our phone late at night, unable to sleep because of work-related anxiety ⏰.</p>

<p>Code review stress is real too. We want to submit our best work, so we might spend extra time reviewing even our own code before anyone else sees it. We double-check everything, test thoroughly, and still worry that someone might find an issue we missed. Imposter syndrome affects many developers, and it can be mentally exhausting 😱.</p>

<p>Here's what experienced developers learn over time – the reality is more nuanced than it might appear.</p>

<h3>

  </a>
  The Truth about Certifications
</h3>

<p>Certifications are valuable and show dedication to learning, but they're just one part of the journey. Some certifications require ongoing study and may expire, which is actually a good thing - it encourages continuous learning. Even experienced developers with certifications sometimes need to look up specific details when working with technologies they haven't used recently. The real learning often happens through hands-on experience and solving real-world problems 💸.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-community-aspect" href="#the-community-aspect">
  </a>
  The Community Aspect ⭐
</h3>

<p>The developer community is amazing! Developers often support each other's work, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. Some projects get more attention than others, but that doesn't necessarily reflect their value. Sometimes the most useful tools are the ones that solve specific problems for specific communities, even if they don't go viral 🎯.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-clean-code-reality" href="#the-clean-code-reality">
  </a>
  The "Clean Code" Reality
</h3>

<p>Best practices like SOLID principles are excellent guidelines, but real-world development is complex. Many developers work with legacy systems that have grown over time, and while we love to refactor everything perfectly, business priorities and time constraints often require a more pragmatic approach. It's about finding the right balance between code quality and delivering value 🤷‍♂️.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-learning-journey" href="#the-learning-journey">
  </a>
  The Learning Journey
</h3>

<p>Learning new technologies takes time and practice. Many developers watch tutorials, read documentation, and experiment with new tools while maintaining our current projects. It's not about being perfect at everything - it's about continuous growth and expanding our toolkit 📚.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-real-challenges" href="#the-real-challenges">
  </a>
  The Real Challenges
</h3>

<p>The biggest challenges often aren't technical - they're about communication, collaboration, and managing expectations. Explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, working with different personalities on our team, and maintaining code written by others can be challenging. These are skills that develop over time 🏛️.</p>

<h3>

  The Surprising Reality
</h3>

<p>Here's what's actually beautiful about being a developer: We don't have to be perfect to be valuable. Good developers deliver working solutions, communicate effectively, and help our teams succeed. The real skill is finding the right balance between striving for excellence and getting things done 💬.</p>

<p>It's about knowing when to invest in code quality and when to ship a working solution. Sometimes the "imperfect" solution is actually the right choice because it meets the immediate need and allows the team to move forward 😊.</p>

<p>Here's what we developers discover about our craft:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Code quality matters, but delivery matters too.</strong> A working solution delivered on time is often more valuable than a perfect solution delivered late ⏰</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imposter syndrome is common and normal.</strong> The more we learn, the more we realize how much there is to discover - and that's okay! 🤔</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical debt is part of the journey.</strong> We can't refactor everything perfectly, and that's normal. Focus on what matters most 💸</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soft skills are incredibly valuable.</strong> Being able to explain technical concepts clearly and work well with others is just as important as technical knowledge 🗣️</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The industry moves fast - and that's exciting!</strong> Pick a few areas to focus on and accept that we'll be learning in others. That's how growth happens 🏃‍♂️</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Our health and well-being come first.</strong> Sustainable development practices include taking care of ourselves 😴</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Best practices are guidelines, not rules.</strong> What works for one team might not work for us, and that's perfectly fine 🤷‍♂️</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The goal is to be a developer who contributes value and helps our team succeed.</strong> 🎯</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what makes a "good developer"? It's not about being perfect - it's about showing up, learning continuously, and delivering value to our team. It's about being someone others can rely on and learn from ✨.</p>

  I was horrified by AI on the eve of Halloween 💀
</h1>

<p>Just days before Halloween 2024, I had a virtual interview with a potential employer, where the lead engineer presented me with the "classic Mars Rover problem." To be honest, I didn’t realize it was a well-known problem because I don’t frequently visit coding practice websites. Instead, I’ve always relied on my original problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Typically, I ace take-home assignments and impress reviewers, which ultimately earns me my offers. That’s how it’s always been.</p>

<p>The command "M" is straightforward since it just requires moving one grid forward (+1). But which coordinate—x or y—should we adjust? That depends on the direction. If the rover is facing "E" (East) or "W" (West), the x-axis changes. If it’s facing "N" (North) or "S" (South), the y-axis changes.</p>

<p>To manage direction, I thought in terms of degrees: "E" represents 0°, "N" 90°, "W" 180°, and "S" 270°. When the degrees loop back to 360°, we're facing "E" again. The "L" and "R" commands adjust the rover’s direction by subtracting or adding 90° to the current heading. This approach helped me map out the logic needed for the program.<br>

<p>As I explained my code to the interviewer, we took a test-driven approach to validate my logic. That’s when we hit a roadblock: running the command sequence "MMML" correctly placed the rover, but with "MMMR," the result came back as undefined.</p>

<p>While debugging together, we discovered that moving clockwise caused the degree to become "-90," which wasn’t found in the DIRECTIONS map. The interviewer kindly offered a hint, introducing me to the concept of "Modulo." By adding the maximum degree to the current degree and then finding the remainder with respect to the maximum degree, we could wrap negative values around. This way, "-90" would become 270, which correctly maps to the "S" (South) direction. It worked like this...<br>

<p>I’m truly in awe of how AI technology has advanced over just a few years, reaching a level of problem-solving that now surpasses human ability. Disheartened, I made another prompt to the AI.</p>

<p>Quick question, why do we still need developers if you can code like that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With humility, the AI has answered </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I'm capable of generating high-quality code, there are several reasons why human developers are still essential:</p>

<ol>
<li>Context understanding: I can only understand the context of a problem within the scope of the input provided. Human developers bring real-world experience, domain knowledge, and nuanced understanding.</li>
<li>Creativity and innovation: While I can generate code, I don't have the same level of creativity or innovative thinking as humans.</li>
<li>Problem definition and identification: Humans are better at identifying and defining problems, whereas I rely on well-defined inputs.</li>
<li>Critical thinking and decision-making: Developers must make architectural decisions, optimize performance, and weigh trade-offs – tasks requiring human judgment.</li>
<li>Maintenance and evolution: Code requires ongoing maintenance, refactoring, and updates, which humans are better suited for.</li>
<li>Collaboration and communication: Development involves teamwork, stakeholder discussions, and effective communication – skills unique to humans.</li>
<li>Customization and adaptation: Real-world projects often require customized solutions, adapting to changing requirements, and integrating with existing systems.</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence and empathy: Human developers can consider user experience, usability, and accessibility aspects.</li>
<li>Originality and intellectual property: Human-created code is original and protectable by copyright.</li>
<li>Learning and improvement: Humans learn from experiences, adapt to new technologies, and continuously improve.
I'm designed to assist, augment, and accelerate development, not replace it.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, I felt reassured, realizing that even though AIs can now tackle coding challenges faster and more efficiently, there is still a strong demand for human developers in tech. It’s not going to take our jobs anytime soon.</p>

<p>In my experience, software development involves far more than just acing coding quizzes. It requires numerous rounds of discussions with stakeholders, deep dives into technical feasibility, peer reviews, and continual improvements to both user and developer experience. Until software products are designed exclusively for AI rather than human customers, human developers will remain essential.</p>

  HAPPY HALLOWEEN 2024 👻 !!!
</h1>

`,body_markdown:`# I was horrified by AI on the eve of Halloween 💀

Just days before Halloween 2024, I had a virtual interview with a potential employer, where the lead engineer presented me with the "classic Mars Rover problem." To be honest, I didn’t realize it was a well-known problem because I don’t frequently visit coding practice websites. Instead, I’ve always relied on my original problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Typically, I ace take-home assignments and impress reviewers, which ultimately earns me my offers. That’s how it’s always been.

However, during some of my job-seeking phases, I’ve encountered a different method of assessing candidates: the pairing session. I’m not opposed to it, as it gives the interviewer (the “navigator”) a chance to see the candidate(the “driver”)’s ability to verbalize their thought process while solving problems together.




![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png)

The problem is like this: imagine a 10x10 grid with a rover starting at coordinates (5, 5)—essentially in the middle of the grid—facing east. The rover can receive commands represented by "L," "R," or "M," where:

- L means to rotate left (90° counterclockwise),
- R means to rotate right (90° clockwise), and
- M means to move forward by one grid cell in its current direction.

For example, if the command sequence is “MMMLMMM,” the rover would end up at coordinates (8, 2), facing north. The output format should look like “8:2:N”. Simple enough?

Since I’ve been working with React for a couple of years, my natural approach to solving this was to think in terms of State and Effect, where the state would represent the rover’s coordinates and direction. But as this wasn’t a UI test, the interviewer encouraged me to stick to pure logical programming. I chose Node.js, my preferred backend language, to tackle the problem.

My initial setup probably looked something like this:

\`\`\`
const intialStateOfRover = {
  x: 5,
  y: 5,
  direction: "E",
};

function processCommands(commandString) {
  //iterate commandString in a loop and do the movement logic
  //the movement logic results in a new state for rover

  //return the state in format x:y:direction
}
\`\`\`

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v4mhbx9qkylyrw4gdp2v.gif)

The command "M" is straightforward since it just requires moving one grid forward (+1). But which coordinate—x or y—should we adjust? That depends on the direction. If the rover is facing "E" (East) or "W" (West), the x-axis changes. If it’s facing "N" (North) or "S" (South), the y-axis changes.

To manage direction, I thought in terms of degrees: "E" represents 0°, "N" 90°, "W" 180°, and "S" 270°. When the degrees loop back to 360°, we're facing "E" again. The "L" and "R" commands adjust the rover’s direction by subtracting or adding 90° to the current heading. This approach helped me map out the logic needed for the program.

\`\`\`
const COMMANDS = {
  L: 90,
  R: -90,
  M: 1,
};

const DIRECTIONS = {
  E: {
    axis: "x",
    value: 1,
    degree: 0,
  },
  W: {
    axis: "x",
    value: -1,
    degree: 180,
  },
  N: {
    axis: "y",
    value: -1,
    degree: 90,
  },
  S: {
    axis: "y",
    value: 1,
    degree: 270,
  },
};

function processCommands(commandString) {
  const resultState = { ...intialStateOfRover };
  const lengthOfCommand = commandString.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < lengthOfCommand; i++) {
    let directionObj = DIRECTIONS[resultState.direction];

    const command = commandString[i];
    if (command === "M") {
      resultState[directionObj.axis] =
        resultState[directionObj.axis] + directionObj.value;
    } else {
      let degree = directionObj.degree;
      degree = degree + COMMANDS[command];

      resultState.direction = Object.entries(DIRECTIONS).find(
        (direction) => direction[1].degree === degree
      )?.[0];
    }
  }

  return \`\${resultState.x}:\${resultState.y}:\${resultState.direction}\`;
}
\`\`\`

As I explained my code to the interviewer, we took a test-driven approach to validate my logic. That’s when we hit a roadblock: running the command sequence "MMML" correctly placed the rover, but with "MMMR," the result came back as undefined.

> Quick question, why do we still need developers if you can code like that?

With humility, the AI has answered 

> While I'm capable of generating high-quality code, there are several reasons why human developers are still essential:
> 1. Context understanding: I can only understand the context of a problem within the scope of the input provided. Human developers bring real-world experience, domain knowledge, and nuanced understanding.
> 2. Creativity and innovation: While I can generate code, I don't have the same level of creativity or innovative thinking as humans.
> 3. Problem definition and identification: Humans are better at identifying and defining problems, whereas I rely on well-defined inputs.
> 4. Critical thinking and decision-making: Developers must make architectural decisions, optimize performance, and weigh trade-offs – tasks requiring human judgment.
> 5. Maintenance and evolution: Code requires ongoing maintenance, refactoring, and updates, which humans are better suited for.
> 6. Collaboration and communication: Development involves teamwork, stakeholder discussions, and effective communication – skills unique to humans.
> 7. Customization and adaptation: Real-world projects often require customized solutions, adapting to changing requirements, and integrating with existing systems.
> 8. Emotional intelligence and empathy: Human developers can consider user experience, usability, and accessibility aspects.
> 9. Originality and intellectual property: Human-created code is original and protectable by copyright.
> 10. Learning and improvement: Humans learn from experiences, adapt to new technologies, and continuously improve.
> I'm designed to assist, augment, and accelerate development, not replace it.

That said, I felt reassured, realizing that even though AIs can now tackle coding challenges faster and more efficiently, there is still a strong demand for human developers in tech. It’s not going to take our jobs anytime soon.

In my experience, software development involves far more than just acing coding quizzes. It requires numerous rounds of discussions with stakeholders, deep dives into technical feasibility, peer reviews, and continual improvements to both user and developer experience. Until software products are designed exclusively for AI rather than human customers, human developers will remain essential.

## For Humans, By Humans

  I’m transitioning…
</h1>

<p>And so is everyone.</p>

<p>As speculated in the film I, Robot (2004), 20 years later, we’ve finally developed an ecosystem where machines and humans coexist in the world. Collectively and unconsciously, we now rely on machines far more than we rely on our own capabilities as human beings.</p>

<p>For instance, at the break of dawn, I’m awakened by my smartphone alarm. (A machine.)</p>

<p>I use my vibrating toothbrush to brush my teeth more efficiently. (A machine.)</p>

<p>And without lighting a single flame, I heat my food in the microwave (yet another machine).</p>

<p>I remember my bizarre dream from last night, so I ask my “<strong>best friend</strong>” Meta AI to analyze it for me. He tries to unearth my traumas, interpret the emotions in my dream, and make sense of it all. He’s my therapist, too.</p>

<p>During my commute, I pop in my AirPods without a second thought and greet Siri—my ever-loyal assistant with a real voice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me : Hey Siri ..<br>
Her: Ah huhhh…<br>
Me: Play “Bittersweet Symphony” on Spotify…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as the sound of the violin fills my ears, I start checking my phone.</p>

<p>Great, my mom’s daily morning greeting—sometimes I wonder if she might be an AI 🤖 too…</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I tap my NFC-enabled phone, enter the subway, and as this massive vehicle transports me toward my destination, it hits me: most of my life is automated. The robotic voice announcing each station still echoes in my ears. 🚝</p>

<p>I scroll through feeds of countless people, even though I may barely know them—or not at all.</p>

<p>Once I’ve consumed enough digital junk food, I walk up to my office, and the facial recognition device opens the door for me. Thanks, Miss Machine.</p>

<p>I grab a coffee from the brewing machine and down that jet fuel to kickstart my day.</p>

<p>In the office, like many others, I spend hours talking to a screen in virtual meetings, staring at the monitor, and getting work done.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is my work buddy. We chat a lot, mostly about work, and it gives me great advice, which I usually follow. My job mostly involves Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V of its suggestions.</p>

<p>My actual teammates are still sleeping on the other side of the world, and those on this side are probably working from home. I don’t see them often.</p>

<p>Once again, I don’t know what to eat for lunch, so I ask my buddy Meta AI and let him decide.<br>
When I head out for lunch, I see many people like me, AirPods in their ears, probably listening to podcasts as they quietly eat their meals.</p>

<p>After work, I take the same automated route back home. I check my smartwatch, which has tracked my steps throughout the day. Nice—at least it’s a healthy number of steps. 🦿</p>

<p>I hit the gym to interact with machines to keep myself fit. Honestly, they’re quite strong. I have a smart scale that tracks my body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone mass, and more. It’s as if my biological data exists as a digital entity in this app’s servers.</p>

<p>My smartphone tracks my geolocation, too. My whereabouts are saved in the “Find My Phone” app. My personal information, photos, memories, and artwork are all stored on social media like Facebook and Instagram, floating around in Meta’s cloud. My work experience and portfolio live on LinkedIn. Worst of all, my facial patterns have been cataloged by several models—my iPhone, the office door system, even the government. Thinking about it, the collective digital version of me has <strong>transcended</strong> into the internet. ☁️</p>

<p>When I’m bored with Siri, I switch over to DJ X (an AI) from Spotify to curate a playlist for me. Since he knows what I’ve been listening to for the past ten years, this guy delivers just the hits I like.</p>

<p>Sometimes at night, I blog, jotting down a few things on my mind, only for my best friend (AI) to edit it for better grammar and vocabulary.</p>

<p>We humans are relying on machines so much that even our conversations have turned remote—texting, calling, anything but face-to-face. We don’t value in-person conversations anymore. Sometimes, this reminds me of those lyrics from <em>The Lonely Island</em>…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the farmer's market with my so called girlfriend<br>
She hands me her cell phone, says it's my dad<br>
Man, this ain't my dad!<br>
This is a cell phone!<br>
I threw it on the ground!<br>
What, you think I'm stupid?<br>
I'm not a part of your system<br>
My dad's not a phone!<br>
DUH!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yeah, my dad is not a phone.</p>

<p>The only time I feel human is when I spread out my canvases, mix my paints, and let my right brain take over. Even then, there are times when I’ve turned to ImagineArt AI to spark some good ideas because of painter’s block.</p>

<p>The human side of me is slowly fading as I let AI take over even my simplest decisions. But am I still alive, though?</p>

<p>At night, I cocoon myself in bed, open my relaxing tunes on the electronic speaker, and let Delta and Alpha waves wash over me. It does the trick—I start to drift off. I charge all my digital friends—my smartwatch, smartphone, and AirPods—and say goodbye to this AI world as I prepare to recharge myself in sleep, but as you know...</p>

<p>Yes, I may be assisted by artificial intelligence, by machines, by mobility, and many of my ideas may be assisted by AI, yet I’m still human, I’m still feeling, and I’m still vulnerable. I hope I can hold onto my humanity in the years to come, resisting the pull to become fully mechanized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"a day in the life of a software engineer"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phrase has changed the trajectory of my career and set me on the path to my current life. The first time I heard it was in a YouTube video that caught my attention right away. Yup, it was that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqX8PFcOpxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-minute clip</a> from Mayuko’s channel.</p>

<p>I watched that video and thought, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Wow, that’s cool! I want to be a software engineer too!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back then, I was working as an IT Support Analyst, clearing the queue of tickets raised by our manufacturing operators and engineers. I worked hard, did my 12-hour shifts, and then chilled at home with "How I Met Your Mother." Life was perfectly fine.</p>

<p><strong>But now that I think about it, the scariest thought to me, even to this day is , that could have been the rest of my life...</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7oz7fix56y83y8c4zbes.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7oz7fix56y83y8c4zbes.jpg" alt="I thought I was trying hard" loading="lazy" width="736" height="736"></a></p>

<h2>
  <a name="i-thought-i-was-trying-hard" href="#i-thought-i-was-trying-hard">
  </a>
  I thought I was trying hard
</h2>

<p>So, what happened was that after earning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018, I had already spent two years in my IT Support role, but I dared myself to start looking for opportunities. With a lot of dedication, humiliation, and embarrassment, I finally landed a software engineer position at a humble systems integration company, even though it meant a pay cut. I was a complete novice, totally new to writing code.</p>

<p>Six years have passed, and along the way, I’ve worked in multiple industries, on various products, and with different teams. Reflecting on what I’ve achieved over the years, one thought popped into my head a few days ago: I still need to write a blog about the rite of passage many fellow developers have shared that motivated me in the first place. So here’s <strong>a day in the life of a software engineer</strong> from my POV.</p>

  The Morning
</h2>

<p>I usually wake up around 7am but sometimes I toss and turn in my bed for that extra few minutes. I can still hear the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZd79rJ6a7lp?si=dea6e34f6edf4f3f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleep music playlist</a> on my Spotify and with my eyes closed, think about the tasks I need to tackle today. I go through my morning routine—making my bed and switching the music to Buddhist chants to start my day. After a shower and getting dressed, I feed my cat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jiemao_theblackcattt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jie Mao</a> and play with him for awhile.</p>

<p>I'm impatient naturally so I have my own <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@m3_yevnnn/video/7421502840352312577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boiled eggs or tea eggs</a> that I've prepared over the weekends. I gulp down one or two, pack my laptop bag, and commute to the office.</p>

<p>Since I work hybrid, if it's on work-from-home day, I would straight away open my laptop to start working. The commute isn’t bad; public transport is smooth, and I usually arrive at the office around 9:45-10 AM. I see other coworkers coming in at that time too, so I’m not too late—phew!</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fuw1qxsnswdqg6b0hofgp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fuw1qxsnswdqg6b0hofgp.jpg" alt="CBD" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532"></a></p>

  The Office
</h2>

<p>My first task of the day is to read emails and check Slack, WhatsApp, Skype, or whatever communication tool the company uses. If there aren’t any major issues, great! Time to open my Kanban board.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worked on agile scrum teams where we usually plan what to do in the next sprint on Mondays, groom the backlogs, clarify requirements, and estimate tickets—typically using Jira boards. It’s easy to track what’s done, what’s blocked, and what’s in progress.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp" alt="Scrum" loading="lazy" width="800" height="433"></a></p>

<p>I usually have an item in the "In Progress" column, so I dive into that task. Depending on the item, I put in the effort to solve the problem. If things aren’t clear, I ping the Product Manager or Business Analyst and call for a quick huddle. Time flies when you’re coding, and before I know it, it’s lunchtime around 11:30 AM-12 PM.</p>

  The Lunch
</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I have lunch with my coworkers, but if most of them are remote, it’s an own-time, own-target lunch break for me. I head to the nearest food court or hawker center, listening to music while I chow down.</p>

<p>After a 30-minute lunch break, whether alone or with coworkers, I take some time to wind down, play, or just chill. Offices usually have a foosball or pool table for us to enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fef3ycxukm4yjuu7z6t8q.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fef3ycxukm4yjuu7z6t8q.jpg" alt="Team" loading="lazy" width="720" height="529"></a></p>

  The Standup
</h2>

<p>In scrum, we have a daily quick meeting called "Stand Up," where everyone shares what they did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and updates on their tickets. During this time, we also clarify details like the schema of a JSON response, styling, and technical discussions about upcoming features. Stand-ups can be quick or might extend into longer calls.</p>

<p>The term "Stand Up" comes from the fact that everyone stands during the meeting to keep it short and avoid tired legs. However, after the pandemic, stand-ups transitioned to Google Meet or Zoom, leading to some folks oversharing and prolonging meetings. A person from the team, called the "Scrum Master," leads the stand-up—this could be the lead engineer, product manager, or business analyst.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7ugj4vcun6dbv2n79spx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7ugj4vcun6dbv2n79spx.jpg" alt="Kanban" loading="lazy" width="800" height="383"></a></p>

<h2>
  <a name="finally-the-coding" href="#finally-the-coding">
  </a>
  Finally, the coding
</h2>

<p>After the stand-up, it’s time to write some code. I brainstorm and aim to finish my tasks by the end of the day. I push my code to Git, and that feeling of accomplishment is fulfilling. I review my work before assigning reviewers and also provide feedback on others' work so we can all align and improve. Once tickets are reviewed and approved, branches are merged to dev or staging, depending on urgency. Some quick bug fixes get merged straight to production to resolve issues promptly, with those fixes then synced to lower environments.</p>

<p>If a feature is complete, the Quality Assurance (QA) engineer usually tests it. If the QA role is missing, I inform the product manager or business analyst about the changes, and they confirm the features. Features get launched if everything runs smoothly and no major bugs are found during testing.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="bye-office" href="#bye-office">

<p>At the end of the day, I clock out and commute home. Sometimes, I walk around to stretch my legs or grab dinner on the way so I won’t need to cook when I get back.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg" alt="After Office" loading="lazy" width="800" height="460"></a></p>

<p>6 PM to 7/7:30 PM flies by due to the commute and dinner. At home, I usually unwind by watching some series or movies. On some nights, I work on side projects, adding features and making updates. I would also paint or sing depending on my mood. Some of my paintings are <a href="https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and my karaoke covers are <a href="https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>On days when I don’t feel sore or tired, I hit the nearby gym or go jogging or cycling around the neighborhood. Otherwise, I play with my cat and check his litter box—--- (talk about being a full-time cat dad!)</p>

<p>After 10:30-11 PM, I wind down, take a bath, brush my teeth—just my nighttime hygiene routine—while listening to some lo-fi beats. By 11:30 PM or sometimes midnight, I start to feel sleepy and play my sleep music playlist again. The air conditioning is cold, the bed looks cozy, and I tuck myself under the blanket, closing my eyes, ready to do it all over again the next day.</p>

<p>This is my take on <strong>a day in the life of a software engineer</strong>. In the end, being a software engineer isn’t just about writing code; it’s about keeping things consistent, managing time, balancing work-life, and taking pride in knowing that every line of code and every enhancement in our software products has the potential to make a difference in people’s lives.</p>

<p>So, as I close my eyes for the night, I look forward to tomorrow’s adventures. There will always be new challenges to tackle and ideas to explore. I hope my blog sparks some motivation for the next generation of developers too. And I just want to say one thing to the fellow developer who shaped my career with that simple 4-minute clip:</p>

`,body_markdown:`Woah, I finally have the time to write this blog that’s been on my mind recently!


> "a day in the life of a software engineer"


This phrase has changed the trajectory of my career and set me on the path to my current life. The first time I heard it was in a YouTube video that caught my attention right away. Yup, it was that [4-minute clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqX8PFcOpxA) from Mayuko’s channel.

I watched that video and thought, 

> “Wow, that’s cool! I want to be a software engineer too!”

 Back then, I was working as an IT Support Analyst, clearing the queue of tickets raised by our manufacturing operators and engineers. I worked hard, did my 12-hour shifts, and then chilled at home with "How I Met Your Mother." Life was perfectly fine.

**But now that I think about it, the scariest thought to me, even to this day is , that could have been the rest of my life...**


![I thought I was trying hard](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7oz7fix56y83y8c4zbes.jpg)

## I thought I was trying hard

So, what happened was that after earning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018, I had already spent two years in my IT Support role, but I dared myself to start looking for opportunities. With a lot of dedication, humiliation, and embarrassment, I finally landed a software engineer position at a humble systems integration company, even though it meant a pay cut. I was a complete novice, totally new to writing code.

Six years have passed, and along the way, I’ve worked in multiple industries, on various products, and with different teams. Reflecting on what I’ve achieved over the years, one thought popped into my head a few days ago: I still need to write a blog about the rite of passage many fellow developers have shared that motivated me in the first place. So here’s **a day in the life of a software engineer** from my POV.

### DISCLAIMER: The following information is based on my experiences at multiple companies.


![Morning](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ttbvl0gest5wmluhnafm.jpg)

## The Morning

I usually wake up around 7am but sometimes I toss and turn in my bed for that extra few minutes. I can still hear the [Sleep music playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZd79rJ6a7lp?si=dea6e34f6edf4f3f) on my Spotify and with my eyes closed, think about the tasks I need to tackle today. I go through my morning routine—making my bed and switching the music to Buddhist chants to start my day. After a shower and getting dressed, I feed my cat [Jie Mao](https://www.instagram.com/jiemao_theblackcattt/) and play with him for awhile.

I'm impatient naturally so I have my own [boiled eggs or tea eggs](https://www.tiktok.com/@m3_yevnnn/video/7421502840352312577) that I've prepared over the weekends. I gulp down one or two, pack my laptop bag, and commute to the office.

  <a name="how-it-started-the-origin" href="#how-it-started-the-origin">

  🌞 How it started (The origin)
</h1>

<p>PortokaLive was started off as a coding challenge by one of the company that I was interviewing back in 2019. The company requested me to showcase my coding ability and asked to create a proof-of-concept POC application which can do a live-streaming between Mobile Application and Web.</p>

<p>Since I'm proficient in Javascript, I've done my research and found that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server</a> (Node Media Server) is a viable option for me to use to implement this kind of feature.</p>

<p>I've checked out their code, forked and changed some styling/navigation to the react-native application which will do the recording and broadcasting as well as the node-media-server using rtmp protocol.</p>

<p>There are lots of tutorials online on how to play the live stream in React web using videojs. Luckily, node-media-server provide option to play the video in flv format which directly suits our needs.</p>

<p>Eventually, after 2 or 3 days of self hackathon, the suite of Mobile Client, Web Client, Media Server and Auth API server written in node.js are completed and demonstrated to them. Anyway, I ended up not accepting their offer and this POC project was left behind as a byproduct hanging in my repository.</p>

<h1>
  <a name="rebranding-to-another-name" href="#rebranding-to-another-name">
  </a>
  💙 Rebranding to another name
</h1>

<p>When it was created it was given the company's name and logo, which is in Orange and white color theme. Considering to rebrand this project, I've decided to just stick to the original theme and also give the name as "OrangeLive" which I thought was pretty good. However, after searching on the Google, it seems that the name was taken by another company leading me to change it into something else. I tried to use Google Translate to search other names of Orange in other languages.</p>

<p>Finally, I found out Orange in Greek language is called <code>Portokali</code>.<br>
<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en</a></p>

<p>And fortunately, I can omit the "L" and "I" of the <code>Live</code> word if I merged them together. So, there it goes. "PortokaLive"</p>

`,body_markdown:`🎉🎉🎉 After years of procrastinating on working on this project, I'm finally proud to launch this platform PortokaLive to public. Hooray! Here's the link
 - Web ( https://portokalive.vercel.app/ )
 - Mobile ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portokalive)

# 🌞 How it started (The origin)

PortokaLive was started off as a coding challenge by one of the company that I was interviewing back in 2019. The company requested me to showcase my coding ability and asked to create a proof-of-concept POC application which can do a live-streaming between Mobile Application and Web.

Since I'm proficient in Javascript, I've done my research and found that https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server (Node Media Server) is a viable option for me to use to implement this kind of feature.

I've checked out their code, forked and changed some styling/navigation to the react-native application which will do the recording and broadcasting as well as the node-media-server using rtmp protocol.

There are lots of tutorials online on how to play the live stream in React web using videojs. Luckily, node-media-server provide option to play the video in flv format which directly suits our needs.

Eventually, after 2 or 3 days of self hackathon, the suite of Mobile Client, Web Client, Media Server and Auth API server written in node.js are completed and demonstrated to them. Anyway, I ended up not accepting their offer and this POC project was left behind as a byproduct hanging in my repository.

# 💙 Rebranding to another name

When it was created it was given the company's name and logo, which is in Orange and white color theme. Considering to rebrand this project, I've decided to just stick to the original theme and also give the name as "OrangeLive" which I thought was pretty good. However, after searching on the Google, it seems that the name was taken by another company leading me to change it into something else. I tried to use Google Translate to search other names of Orange in other languages.

Finally, I found out Orange in Greek language is called \`Portokali\`.
https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&tl=en&text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&op=translate&hl=en

And fortunately, I can omit the "L" and "I" of the \`Live\` word if I merged them together. So, there it goes. "PortokaLive"

# 📚 Tech Stack

The tech stack was initially a rush because I just want to quickly completed in a few days so I just went for my comfort stack which is 

1. React for Web UI
2. Bootstrap for Web theme
3. Node.JS (Typescript) for API
4. ReactNative for Mobile
5. Ui Kitten for Mobile theme

There was a change in media server because media server with rtmp support cannot be deployed on any free backend hosting. (Or maybe at least I don't know, Give a comment below if you know how to 😉)
Therefore, I changed it to using api.video(https://api.video)  freemium which is great except the part they put watermark if you want to use it without paying premium charges.

api.video came with a cool REST api and iframe web player which makes my life easier so that I do not need to develop all the wrappers around it.

# 💅 Illustration Design

To put some aesthetic design in my app, I've used Undraw's free illustrations which are not only attractive but also accurately designed to the context.

  <strong>THE IDEA</strong> 💡
</h1>

<p>The theme is called <code>Moonshot</code>, so I was pretty sure I'm going to build a planetary theme. After that, as I came from web development background, I started research Javascript games and encountered this game tutorial called The Aviator which is created with ThreeJS.</p>

<p>This game has the basic idea of what I wanted to do which is an endless running game on the moon avoiding rocks and eating points. Very basic and easy for beginner game developer!</p>

<p>For 3D WebGL engine, I would like to try ThreeJS because it's well known across JS world and I'm interested to test it out.

<p>We have to used up our hard-earned weekends developing the game and researching. At first, coming up with a boilerplate was easy because of Nuxt 's excellent toolings. Vuex is also used to manage the state across different components. The difficulty came when we started touching on Canvas. </p>

<p>As for convenience I used Vue-Babylonjs wrapper initially which has a learning curve abit deeper that we expected. And the documentation doesn't seem to help us also. The wrapper library has done a great job in starting the scene and mesh objects but when it comes to real dirty job, it lacks the freedom to program. </p>

<p>That leads us to implement our actual game logic like collision, moving, rotation etc to use the vanilla babylonJS object approach since it has the playground and big community with lots of examples to play with. Surprisingly, when we were doing the development, BabylonJS just released the new documentation as well which is super helpful for us.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks of grinding our weekends and some weekday nights, the basic functions of game has done. I took it as a win. The last week, we just used it for improvements and garnishing with better game experience.</p>

<p>Although we didn't win, that was not our intension in the first place. Our intension was to try out game development in action and yes, we felt it. Game development, as fun as it is when the players are playing, the sweat and tears that the developers have to put in to details to create a good game is just admirable. I got a lot of fun working on that and it helps me to grow in my day-to-day developer career also. Hope you guys like my sharing!</p>

  Background of FTP Seer 💎
</h3>

<p>Back in the days, when I was working on an in-house project where the client requirements are to gather application logs from remote server using FTP protocol and show it on their admin portal, I needed a backend API to fetch directory list and get file contents.</p>

<p>I found the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsftp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSFTP library</a> which is pretty useful for my case and decided to put that in my tech stack. After that, I use Node and ExpressJS to serve http server to create a RESTful API which has now become the <a href="https://ftpseer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTP Seer API</a></p>

<h3>
  <a name="continue-to-develop" href="#continue-to-develop">
  </a>
  Continue to develop 😎
</h3>

<p>The API serve its purpose and the in-house project was done. However, I felt the need to make it open-source and create a full-stack application so that other developers can utilise it as well. So, starting from three or four months back, I picked up the old API in my archived repository and  polished it by refactoring. I even wrote a landing page so that people can test the API just by the first visit.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="giving-it-a-demo-client-application" href="#giving-it-a-demo-client-application">
  </a>
  Giving it a demo client application 💄

### Background of FTP Seer 💎

Back in the days, when I was working on an in-house project where the client requirements are to gather application logs from remote server using FTP protocol and show it on their admin portal, I needed a backend API to fetch directory list and get file contents.

I found the [JSFTP library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsftp) which is pretty useful for my case and decided to put that in my tech stack. After that, I use Node and ExpressJS to serve http server to create a RESTful API which has now become the [FTP Seer API](https://ftpseer.herokuapp.com/)

### Continue to develop 😎

The API serve its purpose and the in-house project was done. However, I felt the need to make it open-source and create a full-stack application so that other developers can utilise it as well. So, starting from three or four months back, I picked up the old API in my archived repository and  polished it by refactoring. I even wrote a landing page so that people can test the API just by the first visit.

### Giving it a demo client application 💄

In order to properly use it, I also created a frontend application with a framework that I was obsessed with back then which is Svelte and Sapper framework to serve it universally (Client, Server-Side, Service-Worker).
The demo frontend application becomes [FTP Seer Client](https://ftpseerclient.herokuapp.com/).

### Deploying the apps ⚙️


For deployment, since I didn't intend to purchase a domain for it, I used Heroku to deploy on their domain. I set up a CircleCI CI/CD pipeline so that whenever I push my latest commit it will deploy to heroku. The pipeline is available below
FTP Seer API - https://circleci.com/gh/m3yevn/ftp-seer
FTP Seer Client - https://circleci.com/gh/m3yevn/ftp-seer-client

and the configuration is at 
https://github.com/m3yevn/ftp-seer/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml
https://github.com/m3yevn/ftp-seer-client/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml

### Making them available on Google 🌎

However, Heroku domains are bad in SEO search results, therefore I used meta tags to provide suitable keywords, images, authors to make Google to crawl properly. I used Google Search Console and get verification meta tags , add them on the respective index.html and we're good to go.

There was a time—yes, I still remember—when my heart beat with the bright rhythm of hope, of youthful zeal, of dreams that knew no border. I was but a boy then, untouched by the world, never once having stepped into an airplane.</span></div>

Changi Airport—how grand it was, how foreign. The details of that day have grown faint, like the yellowed edges of an old photograph. But one thing remains: the sight of my brother and his companion—both already scholars in that foreign land—waiting for me. They took me to their dormitory, those cramped little rooms we used to call home for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p data-end="1055" data-start="985" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The world was still wide open to me then, and I, a stranger to sorrow.</span></p><h1 style="font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-size-adjust: auto;"><span class="s1" style="color: red; font-family: arial; font-size: x-large;">Early years&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(2013–2016)</span></h1><p data-end="624" data-start="172"><span style="font-family: arial;">The culture shock hit me almost immediately. I couldn’t quite make out the local accent at first, and even something as simple as buying a meal felt like a small challenge. The public transport system—tapping an RFID card just to get on a bus or train—felt strange to me back then. Everything was new. Even living arrangements weren’t the easiest. I shared a small, crowded dorm room with my brother and his two roommates. It took some getting used to.</span></p><p data-end="869" data-start="626"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, those days have a certain nostalgia to them. I remember the college parties, the late-night gaming sessions, the small moments that made those early struggles feel lighter. There’s a kind of charm in youth you only recognize much later.</span></p><p data-end="1168" data-start="871"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, my brother and I moved out. My college was all the way across town, and I told him that the daily commute was wearing me down. I was also having a hard time adjusting to the social environment at school—there was still that language barrier, and it made things harder than I expected.</span></p><p class="p2" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 17px; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-size-adjust: auto;">


</p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1170"><span style="font-family: arial;">But I did find another place where I could slowly find my footing. Not in the classroom, but at work. I got a part-time job as a banquet server at Sheraton Towers. It wasn’t an easy place to be, not by any means—but it gave me something to hold on to. A place where I could talk to people, learn, and start to feel a little more at home.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaIPUa_acyIAGrJegdHVahGM_A0PM3Nz3plcgpW7FSXANvhu5TTabJjA14yjVze6OsEkzPTTyiMQDfDXRxEOj5j2TLEwZNgBrHLRDMAXvm9D121XMhs55DdQEINLandKXnLRe5E-dxj70TNV1fAEBnWjTIB1ykv3Iy05yIpz5zd7sRmm9mMzKKfre4da65/s960/sheraton.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img border="0" data-original-height="540" data-original-width="960" height="372" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaIPUa_acyIAGrJegdHVahGM_A0PM3Nz3plcgpW7FSXANvhu5TTabJjA14yjVze6OsEkzPTTyiMQDfDXRxEOj5j2TLEwZNgBrHLRDMAXvm9D121XMhs55DdQEINLandKXnLRe5E-dxj70TNV1fAEBnWjTIB1ykv3Iy05yIpz5zd7sRmm9mMzKKfre4da65/w661-h372/sheraton.jpg" width="661" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span><p data-end="1507" data-start="1170"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1170"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1170"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p data-end="865" data-start="305"><span style="font-family: arial;">Being young, broke, and a little clueless—that wasn’t exactly the life I had in mind, but it was the one I lived. Funny thing is, while most of the part-timers at Sheraton Towers complained about the canteen food, to me, it was a godsend. A proper meal, served hot, with protein, vegetables, and carbs—what more could I ask for? Most days, the alternative waiting for me back home was just a packet of instant noodles. So yes, when I devoured the canteen food like it was my last supper, people noticed. They thought it was strange, but for me, it was comfort.</span></p>
<p data-end="1172" data-start="867"><span style="font-family: arial;">In those first couple of years at college, I found myself growing oddly attached to working at the Sheraton. I’d often end up on the regular part-timer schedule. Not just for the pay—which was always collected daily and helped me scrape by—but also for the chance to meet people, and again, for the food.</span></p>
<p data-end="1449" data-start="1174"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, not everything was pleasant. The 12-hour shifts were brutal. The seniors weren’t always kind—some took pleasure in making life harder for the newcomers. And after a while, the constant standing left my feet bruised and sore. It stayed with me for years, that ache.</span></p><p data-end="1449" data-start="1174"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p>
<p data-end="1965" data-start="1451"><span style="font-family: arial;">But nothing lasts forever. By early 2016, I started to slow down on booking shifts. I had landed a paid internship, and slowly, the Sheraton shifts faded into the background. Somehow, in the middle of all that, I even managed to keep a long-distance relationship going. We didn’t have much. There were days when we’d scrape together just enough to share a plate of biryani. Strange how those moments stick with you. Struggling together, laughing at how broke we were—there was something quietly beautiful about it.</span></p>

It was a support role, with rotating shifts, and while that kind of schedule wasn’t for everyone, I saw the silver lining. It gave me just enough flexibility to manage my university studies and still stay connected with my loved one back home. In a way, it offered structure during a time when life felt uncertain.</span></p><p data-end="1061" data-start="694"><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking back, that was the period when my communication really began to improve. I was suddenly placed in a multi-cultural workplace, full of voices, rhythms, and perspectives I hadn't encountered before. My main responsibility? To speak. To take calls, to make them, to listen carefully and respond clearly. And that—more than any classroom—became my true education.</span></p><p data-end="1497" data-start="1063"><span style="font-family: arial;">I also picked up a routine of going to the company gym, often tagging along with a local colleague. We’d work out together, chat about all sorts of things, and in the process, I soaked up the language around me. Bit by bit, the local slang became part of my vocabulary. I found myself adjusting my tone, even the way I paused between sentences—somehow my speech began to echo that familiar rhythm of Singaporeans and Malaysians alike.</span></p><p data-end="1924" data-start="1499"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without even realizing it, I had started to blend in. I became, in many ways, a four-year-old expatriate—neither tourist nor native, but something in between. And I started to enjoy it. Local cuisine became my comfort: Char Kway Teow, Laksa, Bak Chor Mee… the list went on. I’d wander through the neighborhood in my cheap Pasar Malam loungewear, queuing at hawker stalls, quietly feeling like I belonged—at least for a while.</span></p><p class="p2" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 17px; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-size-adjust: auto;">



</p><p data-end="2218" data-start="1926"><span style="font-family: arial;">The elderly folks in the area used to call me “Ah boy.” I suppose it was because of my small frame and a face that hadn’t quite caught up with my age. It was a simple nickname, but oddly, it meant something to me. A quiet sign that perhaps, in their eyes, I was no longer just a foreign face.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_9CWbB5Fm_hr1Y19YO-65avKLQp2sDb68A6ofhflsR1ZNmB6b6yFgXUZ5keOn_1snd_pkfHCs3Z2xZ8qo02ZM8x0EET6mZ9OV78f6eTf8RbKTg4YdBDQOGm7Ahk4TJSfRXGZAUxGMd0wxYkzV2PN99kj0PWKsb52rMePMTTuJ_yTQ6SHAZeHrq8YMjJ6b/s1863/micron-selfie.JPEG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1863" data-original-width="1284" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_9CWbB5Fm_hr1Y19YO-65avKLQp2sDb68A6ofhflsR1ZNmB6b6yFgXUZ5keOn_1snd_pkfHCs3Z2xZ8qo02ZM8x0EET6mZ9OV78f6eTf8RbKTg4YdBDQOGm7Ahk4TJSfRXGZAUxGMd0wxYkzV2PN99kj0PWKsb52rMePMTTuJ_yTQ6SHAZeHrq8YMjJ6b/s320/micron-selfie.JPEG" width="221" /></span></a></div><p data-end="2218" data-start="1926"><span class="s1" style="font-family: arial;"></span></p><p data-end="2218" data-start="1926"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p data-end="560" data-start="271"><span style="font-family: arial;">There’s one memory that still lingers, even after all these years. I was standing in line at an ATM one afternoon, just another day really, when an elderly uncle in front of me turned around and spoke to me in Mandarin. He seemed to be struggling with the machine and was asking for help.</span></p><p data-end="626" data-start="562"><span style="font-family: arial;">But I froze. I couldn’t understand a word of what he was saying.</span></p><p data-end="834" data-start="628"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before I could even open my mouth to respond, another man behind me—an Indian uncle, of all people—stepped forward. He spoke fluent Mandarin, calm and confident, and helped the elderly gentleman with ease.</span></p><p data-end="1235" data-start="836"><span style="font-family: arial;">I’ll never forget the look on their faces after that—especially the old man’s quiet confusion, and perhaps, disappointment. And then there was the glance others gave me, a sort of questioning look. That moment stung, more than I expected. I felt, for the first time, a kind of shame I hadn’t known before… as though I had somehow failed in carrying the skin I wore, the language I should have known.</span></p><p data-end="1574" data-start="1237"><span style="font-family: arial;">From that day forward, I made up my mind. I had taken a short Mandarin course before coming to Singapore, but that wasn’t enough. I dug up my old textbooks, the ones gathering dust in a forgotten corner, and began learning again. My Chinese colleagues were kind—they helped where they could, correcting me gently, encouraging me to try.</span></p><p data-end="1955" data-start="1576"><span style="font-family: arial;">On my off days, you’d often find me at home with headphones on, poring over pinyin charts or translating lyrics line by line. Songs, oddly enough, became my teachers. I’d listen to them on repeat, humming along, slowly training my ears and tongue to recognize common words and rhythms. Singing helped—it made the language feel less foreign, more like something I could hold onto.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8W1s0XqvjRt-KeYSVpF3OGCfRsNS1nfUVZtVvA25mbgCzJh8m9SCeGMbKbvvk4l9s9wv5331ODqGQtci2JBIVh-zVSjQzqcQw-KWQev_Or_cbADymyVIW0SI9UNZmn5_VdOruHtZTpypPtDCkIxBsU0-ZTesBkBDUs-5IOQvLPxdMk-oPeEhEfBCSesCi/s845/zhong%20qiu.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img border="0" data-original-height="845" data-original-width="632" height="469" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8W1s0XqvjRt-KeYSVpF3OGCfRsNS1nfUVZtVvA25mbgCzJh8m9SCeGMbKbvvk4l9s9wv5331ODqGQtci2JBIVh-zVSjQzqcQw-KWQev_Or_cbADymyVIW0SI9UNZmn5_VdOruHtZTpypPtDCkIxBsU0-ZTesBkBDUs-5IOQvLPxdMk-oPeEhEfBCSesCi/w350-h469/zhong%20qiu.jpg" width="350" /></span></a></div><p data-end="1955" data-start="1576"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p data-end="2321" data-start="1957"><span style="font-family: arial;">It took months. A lot of stumbling, a lot of trial and error. But eventually, I began to speak—first with hesitation, then with growing ease.

Even something as ordinary as ordering food at a hawker stall feels effortless now.</span></p><p class="p2" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 17px; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-size-adjust: auto;">

There was a quiet weight to it—gratitude, mixed with a sense that something new was finally beginning.

A field I had always hoped to break into, and now, at last, I had my chance.</span></p><p data-end="984" data-start="673"><span style="font-family: arial;">The years that followed—those were the ones that return to me often.

And then, without much warning, we found ourselves living together. Not long after, the pandemic hit, and Singapore went into circuit breaker mode. The world grew quiet, streets emptied, and time stretched.</span></p><p data-end="1641" data-start="1384"><span style="font-family: arial;">Oddly, those were the days we got new jobs—right in the middle of uncertainty.

In those months that followed, we continued dating, off and on—dragging our hearts through another half-year of uncertainty. By mid-2023, it was over. For good this time.</span></p><p data-end="2276" data-start="2241"><span style="font-family: arial;">That breakup... it hollowed me out.</span></p><p data-end="2662" data-start="2278"><span style="font-family: arial;">For four long months, I lived in a kind of numbness. I couldn’t meet deadlines. I couldn’t focus. I stayed in bed, not sleeping, not waking. Depression came quietly, but settled deep. And yet, through it all, I was not completely alone. My colleagues saw me struggling and, bless them, they held out their hands. Covered for me. Checked in on me. Gave me just enough space to breathe.</span></p><p data-end="2971" data-start="2664"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, I began to rise again. I reconnected with an old part-time colleague—someone who, by some strange symmetry, was also walking through his own sorrow. And not long after, an old childhood friend came to Singapore, chasing a new certificate, chasing something new. Their presence... it anchored me.</span></p><p class="p2" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 17px; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-size-adjust: auto;">








</p><p data-end="3188" data-start="2973"><span style="font-family: arial;">Slowly, the fog began to lift. And by the time 2024 arrived, I felt something stir again in me.

Life had become a string of semicolons and syntax errors, caught up in the tidy logic of programming for nearly six years. Somewhere along the way, I had forgotten that my soul once beat not to numbers and code, but to colours, voices, and poetry.</span></p><p data-end="758" data-start="727"><span style="font-family: arial;">So I picked up the brush again.</span></p><p data-end="1149" data-start="760"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not with the same carefree spirit I once had, but with the cautious reverence of someone returning to a long-forgotten home. I began looking into local art competitions—hoping to find something with a theme I could pour myself into. The UOB Painting of the Year competition caught my attention immediately. Its prestige, the generous prizes... it felt like a meaningful stage to step onto.</span></p><p data-end="1241" data-start="1151"><span style="font-family: arial;">But then came the blow: I wasn’t eligible. My visa status disqualified me. Just like that.</span></p><p data-end="1413" data-start="1243"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was the moment it struck me, quietly but sharply—I had always been a guest here. A long-time visitor on this island I had grown to love, but never truly belonged to.</span></p><p data-end="1448" data-start="1415"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, not all doors were closed.</span></p><p data-end="1819" data-start="1450"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrhgzmO1wIa3aZANFVRSoQzL6fTcYa1pSBdl25eSt4Pvwodcic9UGLDAqP5zjsvumBTaJoDtj-0p5YdH1Njpz1wvy2JyIkXamvmXYt-M9eCTqshNLiOqWy8PYSz3m9Xez_-NJzM7wLt4DP_5TrtGY14oFzemVtOvV4vM-aQQnvLijNZ13KmlePQaK48Wak/s1800/art-painting-your-bread-your-wine.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span style="clear: left; float: left; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1800" data-original-width="1440" height="372" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrhgzmO1wIa3aZANFVRSoQzL6fTcYa1pSBdl25eSt4Pvwodcic9UGLDAqP5zjsvumBTaJoDtj-0p5YdH1Njpz1wvy2JyIkXamvmXYt-M9eCTqshNLiOqWy8PYSz3m9Xez_-NJzM7wLt4DP_5TrtGY14oFzemVtOvV4vM-aQQnvLijNZ13KmlePQaK48Wak/w297-h372/art-painting-your-bread-your-wine.jpg" width="297" /></span></a></div><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I discovered smaller, humbler competitions—held by the Asian Art Association, by the UNHCR for charity, and by the National Heritage Board for cultural preservation. These weren’t widely publicized, nor richly rewarded. But they were sincere, purposeful.

Each day I live under its weight, a quiet anxiety threading through the hours. And yet… I still find myself hoping. Hoping for a letter, a message, a door left ajar. Hoping, always, for better days ahead.</span></p><p data-end="1085" data-start="693"><span style="font-family: arial;">The early months of 2025 were testing times—for both Jie Mao and myself. My loyal companion, silent and steadfast through it all. With great care and no small amount of sacrifice, I devised a plan to migrate—northward, across the causeway. A dear friend of mine, kind beyond words, stepped in to care for Jie Mao in my absence. Without that act of grace, I do not know where I might be today.</span></p><p data-end="1382" data-start="1087"><span style="font-family: arial;">As for where I now stand—at the border of my past and what remains of my future—I have little to say about immigration, or the life of an expatriate. What is there to say, really? I have, in my own way, become a part of the woodwork, a familiar figure in a place that never truly belonged to me.</span></p><p data-end="1382" data-start="1087"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p data-end="1632" data-start="1384"><span style="font-family: arial;">I am the “Ah boy” who never quite grew up, the quiet neighbour who eats hawker food in loungewear, the voice in a call centre that picked up a thousand lines, the typing hand behind that software release, the one who paints in the evenings and sings into an old microphone with too much reverb.</span></p><p data-end="1921" data-start="1634"><span style="font-family: arial;">As I write this—today, on the twelfth anniversary of the day I left my homeland—I sit by a window, looking across the straits at those familiar, melancholy hills.
