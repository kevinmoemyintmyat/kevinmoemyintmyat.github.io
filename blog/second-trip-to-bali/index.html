But this time, I&#39;m going to go to the places that I haven&#39;t been able to go on <a href="/blog/first-trip-to-bali" class="" data-v-17eac7e9>my first Bali trip.</a> That&#39;s why this time I&#39;ve planned to visit mainly in Ubud, the central region of the Bali island as well as the other interesting places as below. </p><ul class="list-disc pl-10 pt-10 text-xl font-bold" data-v-17eac7e9><li data-v-17eac7e9> Sunset at Tanah Lot Temple </li><li data-v-17eac7e9> Ubud 3-Day Stay </li><li data-v-17eac7e9> Tegalalang Rice terraces </li><li data-v-17eac7e9> Tegenungan Waterfall </li></ul><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> This trip is a special one because I had been watching &quot;Eat, Pray, Love&quot; movie and decided that I needed a healing journey :). On the morning of a sunny 21st December 2023, I came to the airport with my exchanged rupiahs, a backpack and a luggage packed with few clothes. The immigration and checking-in were pretty smooth. As usual, the flight took me around 3 hours to arrive to Ngu Rah Rai airport. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> I took a taxi to my hotel in Seminyak area where I would spend the night. Since this vacation is a slowed down one where I got 5 days to enjoy myself, I travelled not as rush as last time. I decided to just spend the night at the hotel and ordered a dinner from Grab. The hotel room was spacious and enjoyable. The compund has its own swimming pool and also decorated with ancient Balinese arts and statues. <br data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/airport.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>Once again ‚ù§Ô∏è </span></span></p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> Next morning, I walked around Legian beach because the hotel is so close to the beach. The sun was shining brightly on that day. As the fine grains of sand shift beneath my feet with each step, the rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the shore creates a soothing melody. The salty breeze gently caresses my skin, carrying with it the unmistakable scent of the ocean. With each stride, I feel a sense of liberation, leaving footprints in the sand as a testament to my journey. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> After that I had a great lunch at one of the restaurant located in a resort compound in the crowded streets of Legian. <span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/atas-lunch.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>The roasted pork is chewy and cripsy! üòã #Eat #EatPrayLove</span></span></p><div class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9><p data-v-17eac7e9><h2 data-v-17eac7e9>A sunset viewing trip to Tanah Lot Temple</h2> After the satisfying lunch, I walked back to my hotel. I swam in the swimming pool provided and relaxed. As I dip into the cool, crystalline waters, the worries of my mind dissolve, replaced by a sense of weightlessness and freedom. The gentle lapping of water against the pool&#39;s edge provides a soothing soundtrack to my adventure. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> The sun&#39;s warm rays dance upon the surface, casting mesmerizing patterns that add to the enchantment of the experience. Whether you&#39;re leisurely floating on your back, or engaging in a spirited race with friends, swimming in the hotel pool offers a delightful respite, a moment of pure bliss amidst the luxury of your surroundings. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> I took a nap afterwards and woke up again in the evening. I grabbed a Gojek ride to catch the sunset at Pura Tanah Lot, a popular tourist and cultural icon for photography. As the sun sets in a blaze of orange and pink hues, casting a golden glow upon the temple&#39;s weathered stones, Pura Tanah Lot becomes a scene of unparalleled magnificence. Pilgrims and tourists alike flock to witness this awe-inspiring spectacle, as waves crash against the base of the cliffs, adding to the dramatic ambiance. Beyond its stunning natural setting, Pura Tanah Lot holds profound religious significance for the Balinese people, serving as a sacred site for worship and meditation. Visiting Pura Tanah Lot is not just a journey to a picturesque landmark but an encounter with the spiritual essence of Bali, where nature and culture converge in harmonious beauty. <span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/purah-tanah-lot.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>Sunset view of the temple in the sea is stunning. üåá #Pray #EatPrayLove</span></span> I went back to the hotel safely and slept for tomorrow vacation plan. </p></div><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9><h2 data-v-17eac7e9>Spending Christmas in Ubud</h2> On 23rd December 2022, I woke up fresh and booked a taxi to go to Ubud, nestled in the heart of Bali&#39;s lush interior, and a haven for art, culture, and natural beauty. I&#39;m planning to spend my Christmas night in Ubud in a 3-day stay at a quiet hotel. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> The taxi driver lady was very friendly and we had a good conversation about politics around the world, Bali&#39;s tourism and we exchanged our life stories. She told me she studied in Surabaya but as a local Balinese, she preferred to settle in Bali. Her husband was a software developer like me and currently working in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. <br data-v-17eac7e9> I arrived to the hotel and checked myself in for the stay. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> The hotel is a small settlement in the wilderness of Ubud giving me the jungle vibe and also peace and calm. There aren&#39;t many places nearby and I can see the hotel is surrounded by emerald rice paddies and verdant forests, this charming remote small hotel exudes a serene ambiance that gives solace and inspiration. <br data-v-17eac7e9><video controls data-v-17eac7e9><source src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/swimming-in-ubud.mp4" type="video/mp4" data-v-17eac7e9></video></p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> The taxi driver lady suggested me on the way that Ubud is famous for its duck cuisine. So, I&#39;ve decided to have Bebek Batutu at a restaurant near Jalan Monkey Forest. The duck is seasoned with a rich blend of spices, including turmeric, ginger, garlic, shallots, chili peppers, and shrimp paste, among others. The duck is then wrapped in banana leaves and slow-cooked until tender and flavorful. It&#39;s a dish that showcases the complex and aromatic flavors of Balinese cuisine. </p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> Bustling thoroughfare lined with shops, restaurants, cafes, art galleries, and guesthouses, Jalan Monkey Forest is packed with traffics. The road derives its name from the Ubud Monkey Forest, a sanctuary for Balinese long-tailed macaques, which is located at the southern end of the street. Walking along Jalan Monkey Forest, you&#39;ll encounter a vibrant mix of traditional Balinese architecture and modern establishments catering to tourists and locals alike. It&#39;s a popular destination for visitors to Ubud who want to explore its cultural and artistic offerings, shop for souvenirs, or simply enjoy the lively atmosphere. In addition to the shops and eateries, you&#39;ll find various cultural attractions along Jalan Monkey Forest, including temples, museums, and art galleries, making it a must-visit destination for anyone exploring Ubud. <span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/ubud-bebek.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>Hearty duck meal in Ubud. ü¶Ü #Eat #EatPrayLove</span></span></p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9><h2 data-v-17eac7e9>Tegalalang Rice Terrace</h2> After having my meal, I roamed around Ubud with a rented motorcycle. I went to multiple famous temples around Ubud, instagram-worthy spots for photography like Bali Swing, and most importantly tegalalang rice terraces. The best gate that you can enter the rice terrace is called <b data-v-17eac7e9>Uma Ceking</b>. The terraced rice fields offer stunning views of lush greenery cascading down the valley, creating a picturesque landscape that&#39;s popular among tourists and photographers. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> Many visitors (families, couples, newly weds) come here to admire the beauty of the landscape, take photos, and also to explore the surrounding area, which includes cafes, souvenir shops, and opportunities for trekking or cycling. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> The best experience that I had when visiting tegalalang rice terrace is when I started to trek the rice terrace, the rain started to drip. I trek in the rain soaking wet and refreshed at the same time. It&#39;s an adventurous experience indeed! <span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/trekking-uma-ceking.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>Rain or not also don&#39;t care #Love #EatPrayLove</span></span></p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> I came back to the hotel and freshened up myself. Rested, changed clothes and prepared to meditate. I was actually living like Julia Roberts haha üòÜ <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> I even thought of visiting the famous &quot;Ketut Liyer&quot; who in the movie, gave many wise words to the main character &quot;Elizabeth Gilbert&quot;. In the movie, Gilbert recounts her journey to Bali, where she meets Ketut Liyer and experiences a palm reading and healing session with him. Ketut Liyer was known for his jovial personality, wisdom, and traditional healing practices, which often included palmistry and herbal remedies. He became a beloved figure among visitors to Bali, and his portrayal in &quot;Eat, Pray, Love&quot; further increased his popularity. Unfortunately, Ketut Liyer passed away in 2016 at the age of 100. Despite his passing, his legacy as a healer and cultural icon in Bali lives on, and his story continues to inspire travelers and those interested in traditional healing practices. I will always cherish those wise words throughout my healing journey. <span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/quote-ketut.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>Even smile from your liver üòä #Love #EatPrayLove</span></span></p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> Another day of my vacation was spent mostly like that. I meditated in the hotel room when it is too hot and only went out when I&#39;m hungry. And at night, it was the Christmas eve night of 2023 already. I decided to spend my Christmas night at a great bar in the Jalan Monkey Forest. I scouted and found a good one which is packed with live music, many friendly people of both tourists and locals-alike. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> There were lots of Christmas songs and music. I even helped a guy I met there who was quite lost around Ubud because his hotel was far away and he couldn&#39;t go back to his hotel. So, in the morning of Christmas day in a tropical island Bali, I found myself bringing a new-faced passenger on my motorbike to his hotel. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> Around that hours of 6-7 AM, there were no motorbikes or cars around in the hilly streets of Ubud; the ride was amazing and the wind rushing on my face gave me a new-found hope and healing. I said goodbye to the stranger I met at the bar after I have sent him to his hotel and rode myself back to the hotel. </p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9><h2 data-v-17eac7e9>Cleansing my soul at Tegenungan Waterfall</h2> I couldn&#39;t sleep that much because I felt I was missing out on time since the vacation was going to end soon after two days. I checked out of the hotel and booked a Grab taxi to Tegenungan Waterfall. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> The waterfall is is located in the village of Tegenungan, Gianyar Regency, not far from Ubud. The waterfall is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a serene setting for visitors to enjoy the beauty of nature. Tegenungan Waterfall is easily accessible, with a short walk from the parking area to the waterfall itself. Upon arrival, visitors are greeted by the sight and sound of the waterfall cascading down into a shallow pool below. Many visitors enjoy swimming in the pool or simply relaxing and taking in the scenic surroundings. The waterfall is at its most impressive during the rainy season when the water flow is strongest, but it remains a popular destination year-round. There are also viewpoints and observation decks where visitors can capture stunning photos of the waterfall and the surrounding landscape. In addition to admiring the waterfall, visitors can explore the area around Tegenungan, which includes walking paths, souvenir shops, and small cafes serving refreshments. </p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> I had myself a place at a Day Club just right beside the waterfall which is called Omma Day Club. I cleansed myself of bad energies in the natural water of the waterfall. And had a shower in the Day club. This trip from Ubud central to Tegenungan took me the whole day. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-card" data-v-17eac7e9><img src="/blog/second-trip-to-bali/tegenungan-waterfall.png" class="blog-img" data-v-17eac7e9><span class="blog-img-title" data-v-17eac7e9>Cleansing and healing with natural water üòä #Love #EatPrayLove</span></span></p><p class="pt-10" data-v-17eac7e9> Coming to an end for this trip, I took another taxi from the waterfall to Sanur Beach which I still love the calmness of the beach from <a href="/blog/first-trip-to-bali" class="" data-v-17eac7e9>my first Bali trip.</a><br data-v-17eac7e9> I slept at a homestay where there were other travelers as well. From my guessing, they might be a group of students from Singapore based on the accent. They were abit noisy at first in the compound but they did lower their voices down after 10 PM. I took a long resting sleep because of the exhaustion I got from the long days of travelling. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> Next morning, I took a walk to the Sanur beach and to my surprise, some things have changed after a year. There were no e-bicycle rental shop along the beach walk. Only bicycles are found and I decided to just use my legs to roam. I swam in the still, shallow waters of Sanur Beach and had a great conversation with another tourist lady and shared about my backpacking experiences. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> After that, I was intended to visit Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK) statue which is a massive cultural landmark located in Bali, Indonesia. It depicts the Hindu god Vishnu riding on the back of the mythical bird Garuda. The statue is one of the tallest in the world and is a prominent symbol of Balinese and Hindu culture. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9> However, I decided not to because of the tight schedule that I have with the departure flight. I checked the timing and it&#39;s another 1 hour ride from Sanur beach, and also I might spend some time in the landmark area so, I might have missed the flight if I&#39;m not careful. Therefore, I decided to just hang out at the Sanur beach with my most favorite drink of all time; Pina Colada and called it a day. I headed out to the airport after the last savory sip and took the returning flight back. <br data-v-17eac7e9><br data-v-17eac7e9><h2 data-v-17eac7e9>Well, that&#39;s it. That&#39;s my second solo trip to Bali. I didn&#39;t found Love like Julia Roberts but I did have a great eat, a great prayer and maybe...a new found love for this island.
