I'm spending most of my time working at DT One as a Software Engineer. You can read more about my professional career portfolio in https://kevinmoemyintmyat.gitlab.io.
I ‚ù§Ô∏è swimming in the weekends, sometimes cycling in the city and of course, creating arts and maintaining my projects on my github portfolio.
Aside from that, I enjoy writing blogs, poems and articles. Every now and then, I sing karaoke üé§ on Smule and also experiment with cooking recipes üßë‚Äçüç≥ which are available on my TikTok.
