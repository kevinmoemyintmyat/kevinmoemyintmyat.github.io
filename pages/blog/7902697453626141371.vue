Longer than expected for a Saturday morning. </div><div>My parents stood beside me. Their faces showed curiosity and fatigue. </div><div>We came to see Ho Chi Minh's preserved body. The line snaked around the complex. </div><div>All three of us had mobility issues. Legs and hips protested against standing.</div><br /><div>We didn't go inside.</div><br /><div>We walked around instead. Took photos with the building in the background.</div><div> I thought about preservation. About keeping a myth alive.</div><br /><div>There's a song. "We're going down, down in an earlier round, and </div><div>sugar, we're going down swinging." The line came to me standing there. </div><div>It's a song about a failing relationship, about going down before the final fight, </div><div>before you see how it ends.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvLVOdKLhM_T5YMJmiPcnzr_o9G5FmA7UaOutB2_qy4Iychlsb2nLvbvFD3Th6qNb7cCkHzMdKKyEDCCYpH9bjDiHy7bK-baWSySSZvWgbnTcYEzvyPSZVKLRdQuqI8UnrEZTW_wpjFWXbeY_dcCuaViRZertzqH8Pk2jGxJZSmMCtKCbv2Gd1NaH21seC/s1024/Gemini_Generated_Image_dfk5nddfk5nddfk5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1024" height="449" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvLVOdKLhM_T5YMJmiPcnzr_o9G5FmA7UaOutB2_qy4Iychlsb2nLvbvFD3Th6qNb7cCkHzMdKKyEDCCYpH9bjDiHy7bK-baWSySSZvWgbnTcYEzvyPSZVKLRdQuqI8UnrEZTW_wpjFWXbeY_dcCuaViRZertzqH8Pk2jGxJZSmMCtKCbv2Gd1NaH21seC/w449-h449/Gemini_Generated_Image_dfk5nddfk5nddfk5.png" width="449" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">Built to Last</span></h2><br /><div>The mausoleum demands respect. Massive. Gray. Imposing. </div><div>Brutalist architecture in Soviet style, all concrete and stone, unadorned </div><div>and unapologetic.</div><br /><div>Brutalist architecture is raw and honest, stripped of decoration. </div><div>It doesn't try to be beautiful—it tries to be permanent. </div><div>It tries to stand against time, against weather, against forgetting.</div><br /><div>We didn't see the body. </div><div>The queue was too long, so we walked around the complex instead.</div><div> I found myself more interested in what surrounded the mausoleum than </div><div>what was inside it—the way the building sits in the landscape, </div><div>the way it feels both sacred and strange.</div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">The Last Request</span></h2><br /><div>Ho Chi Minh didn't want to be preserved. </div><div>He wanted to be cremated, his ashes scattered across the country. </div><div>But history had other plans—those who came after preserved him, </div><div>built a mausoleum, created something different from what he had asked for.</div><br /><div>The relationship between the man and his memory is complicated. </div><div>The man is just a body in a mausoleum, </div><div>but the memory is just a line in a song—a myth, a story, </div><div>something that can be reshaped, reinterpreted, remembered. T</div><div>he man who wanted to be cremated is now preserved in glass. </div><div>The man who wanted to be scattered is now contained in stone.</div><br /><div>Ho Chi Minh knew about exile. He spent thirty years away from Vietnam, </div><div>wandering through France, China, Thailand, working as a cook, a photographer, </div><div>a revolutionary. </div><div><br /></div><div>He left as Nguyen Ai Quoc and returned as Ho Chi Minh—"He Who Enlightens." </div><div>He left in defeat and returned in triumph.</div><br /><div>On September 2, 1945, he stood in Ba Dinh Square, </div><div>the same square where his mausoleum now stands.</div><div> He read the Declaration of Independence: </div><div>"Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom."</div><br /><div>Twenty-four years later, on September 2, 1969, he died. The same date. </div><div>The same square. A heart attack in Hanoi, before he could see his country unified, </div><div>before he could see the war end, before he could see victory.</div><br /><div>Six years later, in 1975, the year of the cat, Vietnam was unified. </div><div>Victory came, but he was already gone. He went down in an earlier round, </div><div>before the victory, but he went down swinging—fighting for independence, </div><div>fighting for freedom, even when he knew he might not see it.</div><br /><div>The fight continued. The cause won.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4fgdlNCLby7cgaEQNUjw-AQNVGqedHf1ULFkUiSe9iblZaSpFKGyG1oi5WFWnLw6MG965Ue6G9Zt0-ukJCoe_Mm8_oQu1AF6PmDm5JZnRiKUf4ImWIBoV1tHVDNvYL3qdhg8qX2T0IdG6aecaYIqQA7DDYVwmXwoqj6QS9hjdtzglA9Q8nQKQIPz2mwFL/s1600/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-12-29%20at%2009.39.07.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="900" height="673" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4fgdlNCLby7cgaEQNUjw-AQNVGqedHf1ULFkUiSe9iblZaSpFKGyG1oi5WFWnLw6MG965Ue6G9Zt0-ukJCoe_Mm8_oQu1AF6PmDm5JZnRiKUf4ImWIBoV1tHVDNvYL3qdhg8qX2T0IdG6aecaYIqQA7DDYVwmXwoqj6QS9hjdtzglA9Q8nQKQIPz2mwFL/w379-h673/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-12-29%20at%2009.39.07.jpeg" width="379" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">Uncle Ho: The Godfather</span></h2><br /><div>There's a photo of Ho Chi Minh holding a little girl—his goddaughter, Aubrac. </div><div>He's picking her up, smiling. This is the human side of a revolutionary: </div><div>the man who fought for independence, who wrote poetry, who worked as a cook, </div><div>who held children, who showed hospitality, who was kind.</div><br /><div>But the body is preserved. Monuments are built. His face is printed on money. </div><div>He becomes a symbol, and in that process, sometimes we forget </div><div>the man who held children, who showed kindness, who was human.</div><br /><div>Just beyond the mausoleum, there's his stilt house—the simple wooden structure </div><div>where he actually lived. Humble and unassuming, </div><div>built on stilts over a pond, surrounded by trees. </div><div>The opposite of the mausoleum in every way: small instead of massive, wood instead of </div><div>stone, life instead of death.</div><br /><div>His face is on every banknote. The man who lived in a stilt house is now printed on </div><div>money, preserved in currency, turned into value itself. </div><div>The man who wanted to be cremated is now immortalized in paper and ink, </div><div>passed from hand to hand, used to buy and sell.</div><br /><div>There's irony in that—the humble man on the valuable note, the simple life </div><div>turned into currency, the person made into money.</div><div><br /></div><br /><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">Memory Over Monument</span></h2><br /><div>Maybe some things are meant to fade. Maybe some stories are meant to end. </div><div>Maybe some bodies are meant to return to the earth.</div><br /><div>The mausoleum will stand for a long time, the body preserved for as long as science </div><div>allows. The myth will continue to be told, reshaped, reinterpreted. </div><div>But maybe what matters isn't the preservation itself—it's what we do with the memory, </div><div>how we honor not just the body but the person who lived inside it.</div><br /><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkRscvRPlez5IuyTH7FJzKJGoA724XtRdEVdUVeDjDp6ueI0gjp1H415dIx5mKjLYrZSPgj6fIN4ZCxjJQPSRa5Zy2DLdSO5F4RTdxQKYlM24DSQqkVxutPKVfNO81ACv7gTpJHbLNXqSZ6fFIjy3668h-13nzYb2QuvCxlV-zHCcc-0G1hs8jxJaxncpp/s480/bac-ho-1349147210.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="360" data-original-width="480" height="399" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkRscvRPlez5IuyTH7FJzKJGoA724XtRdEVdUVeDjDp6ueI0gjp1H415dIx5mKjLYrZSPgj6fIN4ZCxjJQPSRa5Zy2DLdSO5F4RTdxQKYlM24DSQqkVxutPKVfNO81ACv7gTpJHbLNXqSZ6fFIjy3668h-13nzYb2QuvCxlV-zHCcc-0G1hs8jxJaxncpp/w532-h399/bac-ho-1349147210.webp" width="532" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">Scattered, Not Preserved</span></h2><br /><div>We walked away from the mausoleum, my parents and I, and I thought about </div><div>how I want to be remembered.</div><br /><div>I don't want to be preserved in glass. </div><div>I don't want to be turned into a monument. </div><div>I want to be cremated, scattered, returned to the earth. </div><div>I want my story to be told, but I want it to be told by the </div><div>people who knew me, not by institutions that might reshape it.</div><br /><div>Maybe that's the difference: a monument is built to last, </div><div>but a memory is built to change. A monument preserves the body; </div><div>a memory preserves the person.</div><br /><div>I want to be remembered as a person—not as a symbol, not as a myth, not as a story</div><div> that can be reshaped. I want to be remembered by the people who knew me, who saw me</div><div> hold children, who saw me show kindness, who saw me be human.</div><br /><div>I want to be remembered for the fight I fought, for the way I went down swinging,</div><div> for the way I believed in something even when I knew I might not see it, </div><div>even when I knew the fight might outlast me.</div><br /><div>Not as a body in a mausoleum. Not as a face on money. Not as a myth. </div><div>Just as a person who fought, who believed, who went down swinging.</div><br /><div>Most people say palms are natural. Palms are not equal. Palms are not fair.</div><div> That's just how it is—some palms are longer, some shorter, some have different lines,</div><div> different fates. That's nature. That's life. Accept it.</div><br /><div>But I attest: the star is equal. Not the palms—the palms are not equal. </div><div>But the star is. The star on the flag is equal. The nations are equal. </div><div>The people are equal. That's not nature. That's belief. </div><div><br /></div><div>That's what we fight for.</div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">The Same Date, Different Year</span></h2><br /><div>On September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh stood in Ba Dinh Square and read </div><div>the Declaration of Independence. He began with words from another declaration,</div><div> from another country, from another time:</div><br /><div><span style="color: #f1fa8c; font-style: italic;">&gt; "All men are created equal. </span></div><div><span style="color: #f1fa8c; font-style: italic;">They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, </span></div><div><span style="color: #f1fa8c; font-style: italic;">among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."</span></div><br /><div>Then he expanded it, made it universal:</div><br /><div><span style="color: #f1fa8c; font-style: italic;">&gt; "In a broader sense, this means: </span></div><div><span style="color: #f1fa8c; font-style: italic;">All the nations on the earth are equal from birth, </span></div><div><span style="color: #f1fa8c; font-style: italic;">all the nations have the right to live, to be happy and free."</span></div><br /><div>He quoted the American Declaration of Independence, </div><div>then the French Revolution's Rights of Man. </div><div>He used their words to claim his own country's freedom.</div><div> He used their principles to deny their colonial rule.</div><br /><div>The star on the flag is equal. The nations are equal. </div><div>The people are equal. Not the palms—the palms are not equal. </div><div>But the star is. The star is equal.</div><br /><div>He ended with: "Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom."</div><br /><div>Twenty-four years later, on the same date, he died—before he could see victory,</div><div> before he could see his country unified.</div><br /><div>Six years later, in 1975, the year of the cat, victory came. </div><div>The fight continued, and the cause won.</div><br /><div>His body is preserved. Monuments are built. His face is printed on money. </div><div>But maybe what matters isn't the preservation—maybe what matters is the victory,</div><div> the independence, the freedom, the words he spoke, </div><div>the declaration he made, the fight he fought.</div><br /><div>Maybe that's what we should preserve: not the body, </div><div>but the victory; not the monument, but the declaration; not the myth, but the truth.</div><br /><div>The mausoleum stands there, a monument </div><div>to a man who went down in an earlier round. But the fight continued. And it won.</div><br /><div>We came to see a building. </div><div>We deviated from our original plan—we didn't see his body, </div><div>we walked around the monument instead. </div><div>We took photos of stone and concrete. We thought we'd remember the building.</div><br /><div>But we walked away remembering the man. Not the brutalist architecture. </div><div>Not the preserved body. Not the monument that will stand for centuries.</div><br /><div>We walked away remembering the person—the one who lived in a stilt house,</div><div> who held children, who went down swinging. </div><div><br /></div><div>The one who believed in something even when he knew he might not see it.</div><br /><div>The building will stand. But we remember the man.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjN_J2toSQ0cAMc2uiuu9ZAowT7aSZYR-Oo7n5ZTAAQzscY2vTsdKf8IbLfyFGpXx4-xoEK4pUn75rYNXozNjK1u2-9f5EPo48LJjUWjzAezqN_08KV2N7OX5HL_HE9-1yFp3Cg8D1QvuaGZgZ6GtkV7mZkyX8GS0mW9kF9qgP8AVXvzSoWhJ7vlr_F3LXV/s800/gia%20tri%20tu%20tuong%20ho%20chi%20minh%20trong%20tinh%20hinh%20moi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="800" height="349" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjN_J2toSQ0cAMc2uiuu9ZAowT7aSZYR-Oo7n5ZTAAQzscY2vTsdKf8IbLfyFGpXx4-xoEK4pUn75rYNXozNjK1u2-9f5EPo48LJjUWjzAezqN_08KV2N7OX5HL_HE9-1yFp3Cg8D1QvuaGZgZ6GtkV7mZkyX8GS0mW9kF9qgP8AVXvzSoWhJ7vlr_F3LXV/w559-h349/gia%20tri%20tu%20tuong%20ho%20chi%20minh%20trong%20tinh%20hinh%20moi.jpg" width="559" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6272a4;">---</span></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #bd93f9; font-weight: bold;">Is This Communist?</span></h2><br /><div>Some might read this and ask: is this communist?
