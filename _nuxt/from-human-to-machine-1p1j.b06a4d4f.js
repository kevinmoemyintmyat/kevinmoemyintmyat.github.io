Collectively and unconsciously, we now rely on machines far more than we rely on our own capabilities as human beings.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>For instance, at the break of dawn, I‚Äôm awakened by my smartphone alarm.

(A machine.)</p><p data-v-b5676a71>And without lighting a single flame, I heat my food in the microwave (yet another machine).</p><p data-v-b5676a71>I remember my bizarre dream from last night, so I ask my ‚Äú<strong data-v-b5676a71>best friend</strong>‚Äù Meta AI to analyze it for me. He tries to unearth my traumas, interpret the emotions in my dream, and make sense of it all. He‚Äôs my therapist, too.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>During my commute, I pop in my AirPods without a second thought and greet Siri‚Äîmy ever-loyal assistant with a real voice.</p><blockquote data-v-b5676a71><p data-v-b5676a71>Me : Hey Siri ..<br data-v-b5676a71> Her: Ah huhhh‚Ä¶<br data-v-b5676a71> Me: Play ‚ÄúBittersweet Symphony‚Äù on Spotify‚Ä¶</p></blockquote><p data-v-b5676a71>And as the sound of the violin fills my ears, I start checking my phone.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>Great, my mom‚Äôs daily morning greeting‚Äîsometimes I wonder if she might be an AI ü§ñ too‚Ä¶</p><p data-v-b5676a71>Jokes aside, I tap my NFC-enabled phone, enter the subway, and as this massive vehicle transports me toward my destination, it hits me: most of my life is automated. The robotic voice announcing each station still echoes in my ears. üöù</p><p data-v-b5676a71>I scroll through feeds of countless people, even though I may barely know them‚Äîor not at all.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>Once I‚Äôve consumed enough digital junk food, I walk up to my office, and the facial recognition device opens the door for me. Thanks, Miss Machine.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>I grab a coffee from the brewing machine and down that jet fuel to kickstart my day.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>In the office, like many others, I spend hours talking to a screen in virtual meetings, staring at the monitor, and getting work done.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>ChatGPT is my work buddy. We chat a lot, mostly about work, and it gives me great advice, which I usually follow.

I check my smartwatch, which has tracked my steps throughout the day. Nice‚Äîat least it‚Äôs a healthy number of steps. ü¶ø</p><p data-v-b5676a71>I hit the gym to interact with machines to keep myself fit. Honestly, they‚Äôre quite strong. I have a smart scale that tracks my body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone mass, and more. It‚Äôs as if my biological data exists as a digital entity in this app‚Äôs servers.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>My smartphone tracks my geolocation, too. My whereabouts are saved in the ‚ÄúFind My Phone‚Äù app. My personal information, photos, memories, and artwork are all stored on social media like Facebook and Instagram, floating around in Meta‚Äôs cloud. My work experience and portfolio live on LinkedIn. Worst of all, my facial patterns have been cataloged by several models‚Äîmy iPhone, the office door system, even the government. Thinking about it, the collective digital version of me has <strong data-v-b5676a71>transcended</strong> into the internet. ‚òÅÔ∏è</p><p data-v-b5676a71><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcrbn2mx8h36wexqnsh7d.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper" data-v-b5676a71><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcrbn2mx8h36wexqnsh7d.jpg" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="500" data-v-b5676a71></a></p><p data-v-b5676a71>When I‚Äôm bored with Siri, I switch over to DJ X (an AI) from Spotify to curate a playlist for me. Since he knows what I‚Äôve been listening to for the past ten years, this guy delivers just the hits I like.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>Sometimes at night, I blog, jotting down a few things on my mind, only for my best friend (AI) to edit it for better grammar and vocabulary.</p><p data-v-b5676a71>We humans are relying on machines so much that even our conversations have turned remote‚Äîtexting, calling, anything but face-to-face.
