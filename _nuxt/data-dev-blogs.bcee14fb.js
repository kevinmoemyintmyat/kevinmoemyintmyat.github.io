  Don't Wait Until You Know Every Port
</h2>

<p>Here's a gentle truth: you don't need to know every technology to be a great captain. You just need to know how to navigate.</p>

<p>The thing is, you won't know your leadership style until you start guiding others. You won't discover your strengths until you've weathered a few different storms.</p>

<p>I've seen developers get stuck trying to master every technology before leading a project. They spend months studying every framework, every design pattern, every architecture approach. Meanwhile, other developers are leading teams, learning from their mistakes, and getting better every day.</p>

<p>I remember leading a couple of projects where I had to coordinate with developers across multiple time zones. The morning standup for one team was the evening wind-down for another. It felt like we were constantly chasing the sun around the world, just like my father used to describe navigating across international waters.</p>

<p>Start with someone else's leadership approach. Learn from it. Adapt it to your style. Then try another captain's methods. Keep going until you can't tell whose techniques you've borrowed anymore.</p>

<p>That's when you'll find your unique leadership voice. ⚓</p>

  Lead the Team You Want to Be Part Of
</h2>

<p>The best way to discover what kind of leader you want to be is simply to start leading.</p>

<p>Instead of asking "What should I build?" try asking "What kind of team do I wish I was part of?"</p>

<p>Look at the teams you've been on. The ones that felt a little frustrating. The ones that made you think "there has to be a better way to work together." That's often your best starting point.</p>

<p>I know developers who spend years studying every management theory, every team structure, every communication pattern. They never lead anything because they're waiting for the perfect leadership opportunity to come along.</p>

<p>Some of my closest friends are actual sailors, and they've taught me that the best captains aren't the ones who know every port - they're the ones who can adapt to any situation, communicate clearly with their crew, and make decisions under pressure. The same principles apply when you're leading a development team through a critical bug fix at 2 AM.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other developers are leading imperfect, sometimes chaotic teams. And they're learning. And they're getting better. And eventually, they're building amazing teams.</p>

<p>Start with what you know. Start with what you've experienced. Start with what slightly frustrates you about team dynamics.</p>

<p>The rest will naturally follow. 👥</p>

  From Cadet to Captain: The Journey of Experience 🚢
</h2>

<p>Here's something that gets lost in the romanticized version of captaincy - every captain was once a cadet. Every Software Captain started somewhere, doing the hard, often thankless work that builds the foundation of their expertise. 🎓⚓ Every aspiring Software Captain begins as a cadet - writing their first "Hello World," debugging their first infinite loop, and learning that the code that works on their machine mysteriously breaks in production. </p>

<p>After the initial training, Software Captains progress through roles that involve a lot of "manual labor" - cleaning up legacy code, debugging mysterious production issues, writing tests, and creating documentation. Like chipping away rust and repainting a ship's hull, this work is often invisible to users but crucial for the ship's longevity. Only after accumulating years of this practical experience can someone qualify to become a Software Captain. </p>

<p>So if you're still in your cadet years, don't rush the journey. Learn to love the hard work. Master the fundamentals. Build your experience from the ground up. Because when you finally earn your captain's stripes, you'll know that you've earned them through experience, not just ambition. 🏆</p>

  Navigating the Digital Seas 🌊
</h2>

<p>Every Software Captain will face storms, icebergs, and pirates on their journey. Here's how the best captains navigate these treacherous waters: ⛈️⚓ Every captain faces the storm of technical debt - that accumulated code that slows down your ship like barnacles on a hull. Legacy systems are like icebergs hidden beneath the surface, waiting to sink your carefully planned features. </p>

<p>🧊 In the digital seas, pirates come in many forms - competitors launching similar features, market pressure to ship faster, or AI features that promise to replace your entire crew. These pirates want to steal your cargo (features) and sink your ship (product). 🤖🏴‍☠️ Your crew is everything. A captain is nothing without skilled crews who can handle the rigging (frontend), navigate the engine room (backend), and keep the ship running smoothly (DevOps). </p>

<p>When the storms are raging and the pirates are closing in, your compass is what keeps you on course. In software development, this is your team's values, your coding principles, your commitment to quality. The best captains have a strong moral compass. They don't compromise on security just to ship faster. They don't cut corners that could sink the ship later. They make decisions based on what's right for the long-term health of their crew and their cargo. ⚓</p>

  Finding Tortuga: The Captain's Haven 🏴‍☠️
</h2>

<p>Every Software Captain needs a Tortuga - a place where captains gather to rest, refuel, and share their war stories. In the digital seas, Tortuga isn't a physical island, but a community of fellow captains who understand the weight of command. 🏴‍☠️🍺 Tortuga exists in many forms: GitHub where captains showcase their ships and share code treasures, Dev.to where captains share their voyages and battles with bugs, Stack Overflow where captains go when their ship is taking on water, Discord/Slack communities where captains gather in smaller groups, and conferences where captains from all over the digital seas gather to share discoveries. Every Software Captain who enters Tortuga follows an unwritten code: share your knowledge, help new captains, tell your war stories, respect your crew, and buy the next round by sharing your expertise in return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>⚓ Building Your Advisory Crew</strong></p>

<p>As you progress from Captain to Admiral (CTO), your Tortuga evolves into something more strategic - your Advisory Crew. This isn't just about community anymore; it's about building relationships with mentors, investors, and peer CTOs who can guide your strategic decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Your Advisory Crew Should Include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Technical Mentors:</strong> Senior engineers who've scaled systems before</li>
<li>
<strong>Business Advisors:</strong> Product leaders who understand tech-business alignment</li>
<li>
<strong>Peer CTOs:</strong> Fellow captains navigating similar challenges</li>
<li>
<strong>Industry Veterans:</strong> Leaders who've weathered economic storms</li>
<li>
<strong>Investor Relations:</strong> Board members and stakeholders who need tech updates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regular Advisory Sessions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Monthly 1:1s with key advisors</li>
<li>Quarterly strategic review meetings</li>
<li>Annual advisory board sessions</li>
<li>Crisis consultation protocols</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest challenges every Software Captain faces is knowing when to step back from coding and focus on leading. Here's the reality: ⚓👥</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>🎯 The Leadership Transition Matrix</strong></p>

<p><strong>Software Captain (70% hands-on, 30% leadership):</strong></p>

<li>Mentoring 2-3 team members</li>
<li>Making architecture choices for the team</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lead Engineer (50% hands-on, 50% leadership):</strong></p>

  The Captain's True Compass 🧭
</h2>

<p>Now, here's something most captains never learn - there's a difference between knowing where you are and knowing where you want to go. ✨🗺️</p>

<p>You see, every captain has a compass. Most think it points north, but that's not how the real ones work. The compass that matters doesn't point to true north - it points to what you desire most in the world.</p>

<p>For some captains, it points to treasure - the next big promotion, the perfect architecture, the flawless codebase. For others, it points to a person - maybe a mentor who inspired them, or a team member they're trying to help grow. For still others, it points to a place - that mythical "perfect project" where everything just works.</p>

<p>The thing is, your compass changes. What you wanted when you first set sail isn't necessarily what you want now. And that's not a bad thing - it means you're growing, learning, becoming the captain you were meant to be.</p>

<p>But here's the secret that Jack never tells anyone - the compass only works when you're honest with yourself about what you truly want. You can't fool it with what you think you should want, or what others expect you to want. It only points to what your heart truly desires.</p>

<p>So ask yourself, Software Captain - what does your compass point to? Is it pointing to the right thing? Are you sailing toward what you truly want, or are you just following the winds of other people's expectations?</p>

<p>Because here's the thing about being a captain - you get to choose your destination. You get to decide what treasure is worth pursuing, what port is worth sailing to, what adventure is worth the risk. 🗺️</p>

<p>The seas will always be rough. The pirates will always be out there. The storms will always come. But if you know what your compass truly points to, if you're honest about what you desire most in this world, then you'll always know which way to sail.</p>

<p>And maybe that's the real lesson here - not how to be a perfect Software Captain, but how to be the captain who knows where they're going and why they're going there.</p>

## Don't Wait Until You Know Every Port

Here's a gentle truth: you don't need to know every technology to be a great captain. You just need to know how to navigate.

The thing is, you won't know your leadership style until you start guiding others. You won't discover your strengths until you've weathered a few different storms.

I've seen developers get stuck trying to master every technology before leading a project. They spend months studying every framework, every design pattern, every architecture approach. Meanwhile, other developers are leading teams, learning from their mistakes, and getting better every day.

I remember leading a couple of projects where I had to coordinate with developers across multiple time zones. The morning standup for one team was the evening wind-down for another. It felt like we were constantly chasing the sun around the world, just like my father used to describe navigating across international waters.

Start with someone else's leadership approach. Learn from it. Adapt it to your style. Then try another captain's methods. Keep going until you can't tell whose techniques you've borrowed anymore.

That's when you'll find your unique leadership voice. ⚓

![A software captain learning to navigate different USB ports and digital harbors](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3usj9z9krx0zr6qk1lc3.png)

## Lead the Team You Want to Be Part Of

The best way to discover what kind of leader you want to be is simply to start leading.

Instead of asking "What should I build?" try asking "What kind of team do I wish I was part of?"

Look at the teams you've been on. The ones that felt a little frustrating. The ones that made you think "there has to be a better way to work together." That's often your best starting point.

I know developers who spend years studying every management theory, every team structure, every communication pattern. They never lead anything because they're waiting for the perfect leadership opportunity to come along.

Some of my closest friends are actual sailors, and they've taught me that the best captains aren't the ones who know every port - they're the ones who can adapt to any situation, communicate clearly with their crew, and make decisions under pressure. The same principles apply when you're leading a development team through a critical bug fix at 2 AM.

Meanwhile, other developers are leading imperfect, sometimes chaotic teams. And they're learning. And they're getting better. And eventually, they're building amazing teams.

Start with what you know. Start with what you've experienced. Start with what slightly frustrates you about team dynamics.

The rest will naturally follow. 👥

## From Cadet to Captain: The Journey of Experience 🚢

Here's something that gets lost in the romanticized version of captaincy - every captain was once a cadet. Every Software Captain started somewhere, doing the hard, often thankless work that builds the foundation of their expertise. 🎓⚓ Every aspiring Software Captain begins as a cadet - writing their first "Hello World," debugging their first infinite loop, and learning that the code that works on their machine mysteriously breaks in production. 

After the initial training, Software Captains progress through roles that involve a lot of "manual labor" - cleaning up legacy code, debugging mysterious production issues, writing tests, and creating documentation. Like chipping away rust and repainting a ship's hull, this work is often invisible to users but crucial for the ship's longevity. Only after accumulating years of this practical experience can someone qualify to become a Software Captain. 

So if you're still in your cadet years, don't rush the journey. Learn to love the hard work. Master the fundamentals. Build your experience from the ground up. Because when you finally earn your captain's stripes, you'll know that you've earned them through experience, not just ambition. 🏆

## Navigating the Digital Seas 🌊

Every Software Captain will face storms, icebergs, and pirates on their journey. Here's how the best captains navigate these treacherous waters: ⛈️⚓ Every captain faces the storm of technical debt - that accumulated code that slows down your ship like barnacles on a hull. Legacy systems are like icebergs hidden beneath the surface, waiting to sink your carefully planned features. 

🧊 In the digital seas, pirates come in many forms - competitors launching similar features, market pressure to ship faster, or AI features that promise to replace your entire crew. These pirates want to steal your cargo (features) and sink your ship (product). 🤖🏴‍☠️ Your crew is everything. A captain is nothing without skilled crews who can handle the rigging (frontend), navigate the engine room (backend), and keep the ship running smoothly (DevOps). 

When the storms are raging and the pirates are closing in, your compass is what keeps you on course. In software development, this is your team's values, your coding principles, your commitment to quality. The best captains have a strong moral compass. They don't compromise on security just to ship faster. They don't cut corners that could sink the ship later. They make decisions based on what's right for the long-term health of their crew and their cargo. ⚓

## Finding Tortuga: The Captain's Haven 🏴‍☠️

Every Software Captain needs a Tortuga - a place where captains gather to rest, refuel, and share their war stories. In the digital seas, Tortuga isn't a physical island, but a community of fellow captains who understand the weight of command. 🏴‍☠️🍺 Tortuga exists in many forms: GitHub where captains showcase their ships and share code treasures, Dev.to where captains share their voyages and battles with bugs, Stack Overflow where captains go when their ship is taking on water, Discord/Slack communities where captains gather in smaller groups, and conferences where captains from all over the digital seas gather to share discoveries. Every Software Captain who enters Tortuga follows an unwritten code: share your knowledge, help new captains, tell your war stories, respect your crew, and buy the next round by sharing your expertise in return.

> **⚓ Building Your Advisory Crew**
> 
> As you progress from Captain to Admiral (CTO), your Tortuga evolves into something more strategic - your Advisory Crew. This isn't just about community anymore; it's about building relationships with mentors, investors, and peer CTOs who can guide your strategic decisions.
> 
> **Your Advisory Crew Should Include:**
> - **Technical Mentors:** Senior engineers who've scaled systems before
> - **Business Advisors:** Product leaders who understand tech-business alignment
> - **Peer CTOs:** Fellow captains navigating similar challenges

The seas are rough, the pirates are many, and the storms are unpredictable. But with a good crew, a reliable map, a strong compass, and a Tortuga to call home, any Software Captain can navigate these waters and deliver their cargo safely to port. 🌊

## Balancing Hands-On Work vs Leadership ⚖️

One of the biggest challenges every Software Captain faces is knowing when to step back from coding and focus on leading. Here's the reality: ⚓👥

> **🎯 The Leadership Transition Matrix**
> 
> **Software Captain (70% hands-on, 30% leadership):**
> - Still writing code daily
> - Leading by example in technical decisions
> - Mentoring 2-3 team members
> - Making architecture choices for the team
> 
> **Lead Engineer (50% hands-on, 50% leadership):**
> - Coding 3-4 days per week
> - Leading technical direction across teams
> - Managing team performance and growth
> - Balancing technical debt with new features
> 
> **CTO (20% hands-on, 80% strategy/people):**
> - Coding only for strategic prototypes
> - Setting company-wide technical vision
> - Managing multiple teams and departments
> - Board-level communication and strategy
> 
> **When to Step Back from Coding:**
> - Your team is waiting for your code reviews
> - You're the bottleneck for architectural decisions
> - You're spending more time debugging than leading
> - Your team needs more strategic direction than hands-on help

## The Captain's True Compass 🧭

Now, here's something most captains never learn - there's a difference between knowing where you are and knowing where you want to go. ✨🗺️

You see, every captain has a compass. Most think it points north, but that's not how the real ones work. The compass that matters doesn't point to true north - it points to what you desire most in the world.

For some captains, it points to treasure - the next big promotion, the perfect architecture, the flawless codebase. For others, it points to a person - maybe a mentor who inspired them, or a team member they're trying to help grow. For still others, it points to a place - that mythical "perfect project" where everything just works.

The thing is, your compass changes. What you wanted when you first set sail isn't necessarily what you want now. And that's not a bad thing - it means you're growing, learning, becoming the captain you were meant to be.

But here's the secret that Jack never tells anyone - the compass only works when you're honest with yourself about what you truly want. You can't fool it with what you think you should want, or what others expect you to want. It only points to what your heart truly desires.

So ask yourself, Software Captain - what does your compass point to? Is it pointing to the right thing? Are you sailing toward what you truly want, or are you just following the winds of other people's expectations?

Because here's the thing about being a captain - you get to choose your destination. You get to decide what treasure is worth pursuing, what port is worth sailing to, what adventure is worth the risk. 🗺️

The seas will always be rough. The pirates will always be out there. The storms will always come. But if you know what your compass truly points to, if you're honest about what you desire most in this world, then you'll always know which way to sail.

And maybe that's the real lesson here - not how to be a perfect Software Captain, but how to be the captain who knows where they're going and why they're going there.

<p>There are many talented developers out there, and it's inspiring to see our achievements! Looking at LinkedIn profiles and social media posts, you'll find developers with impressive badges, certifications, and contributions that showcase our dedication to the craft. Many have earned that coveted "Senior" title through hard work and experience. We write clean, maintainable code, follow best practices like SOLID principles, and craft commit messages that tell the story of our work 📝.</p>

<p>These developers often have structured routines - maybe we start our day early and then dive into our work with focus. We check our notifications, review pull requests thoughtfully, and write code with care. We're the kind of developers who read documentation thoroughly and ask thoughtful questions. We write comprehensive unit tests and consider edge cases that others might miss 🧪.</p>

<p>Our code reviews are thorough and constructive. We spot potential issues early, suggest helpful optimizations, and ensure proper error handling. Our colleagues appreciate our expertise and often turn to us for guidance. We're constantly learning and growing, staying up-to-date with industry trends and experimenting with new technologies 🚀.</p>

  Stress is the killer of joy from coding 😰
</h2>

<p>But here's what many developers don't talk about openly – the pressure can be overwhelming. The tech industry moves incredibly fast, and keeping up while maintaining quality work, mentoring others, and having a life outside of work can feel impossible 😮‍💨.</p>

<p>Every time a new framework or tool gains popularity, there's this nagging feeling of falling behind. The stress shows up in different ways - maybe we wake up in the middle of the night thinking about a bug we might have missed, or we probably dream about work problems. Sometimes we find ourselves checking our phone late at night, unable to sleep because of work-related anxiety ⏰.</p>

<p>Code review stress is real too. We want to submit our best work, so we might spend extra time reviewing even our own code before anyone else sees it. We double-check everything, test thoroughly, and still worry that someone might find an issue we missed. Imposter syndrome affects many developers, and it can be mentally exhausting 😱.</p>

  Reality bites us all more than the bugs💡🐜
</h2>

<p>Here's what experienced developers learn over time – the reality is more nuanced than it might appear.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-truth-about-certifications" href="#the-truth-about-certifications">
  </a>
  The Truth about Certifications
</h3>

<p>Certifications are valuable and show dedication to learning, but they're just one part of the journey. Some certifications require ongoing study and may expire, which is actually a good thing - it encourages continuous learning. Even experienced developers with certifications sometimes need to look up specific details when working with technologies they haven't used recently. The real learning often happens through hands-on experience and solving real-world problems 💸.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-community-aspect" href="#the-community-aspect">
  </a>
  The Community Aspect ⭐
</h3>

<p>The developer community is amazing! Developers often support each other's work, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. Some projects get more attention than others, but that doesn't necessarily reflect their value. Sometimes the most useful tools are the ones that solve specific problems for specific communities, even if they don't go viral 🎯.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-clean-code-reality" href="#the-clean-code-reality">
  </a>
  The "Clean Code" Reality
</h3>

<p>Best practices like SOLID principles are excellent guidelines, but real-world development is complex. Many developers work with legacy systems that have grown over time, and while we love to refactor everything perfectly, business priorities and time constraints often require a more pragmatic approach. It's about finding the right balance between code quality and delivering value 🤷‍♂️.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-learning-journey" href="#the-learning-journey">
  </a>
  The Learning Journey
</h3>

<p>Learning new technologies takes time and practice. Many developers watch tutorials, read documentation, and experiment with new tools while maintaining our current projects. It's not about being perfect at everything - it's about continuous growth and expanding our toolkit 📚.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-real-challenges" href="#the-real-challenges">
  </a>
  The Real Challenges
</h3>

<p>The biggest challenges often aren't technical - they're about communication, collaboration, and managing expectations. Explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, working with different personalities on our team, and maintaining code written by others can be challenging. These are skills that develop over time 🏛️.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="the-surprising-reality" href="#the-surprising-reality">
  </a>
  The Surprising Reality
</h3>

<p>Here's what's actually beautiful about being a developer: We don't have to be perfect to be valuable. Good developers deliver working solutions, communicate effectively, and help our teams succeed. The real skill is finding the right balance between striving for excellence and getting things done 💬.</p>

<p>It's about knowing when to invest in code quality and when to ship a working solution. Sometimes the "imperfect" solution is actually the right choice because it meets the immediate need and allows the team to move forward 😊.</p>

  What Developers Actually Learn 💡
</h2>

<p>Here's what we developers discover about our craft:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Code quality matters, but delivery matters too.</strong> A working solution delivered on time is often more valuable than a perfect solution delivered late ⏰</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imposter syndrome is common and normal.</strong> The more we learn, the more we realize how much there is to discover - and that's okay! 🤔</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical debt is part of the journey.</strong> We can't refactor everything perfectly, and that's normal. Focus on what matters most 💸</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soft skills are incredibly valuable.</strong> Being able to explain technical concepts clearly and work well with others is just as important as technical knowledge 🗣️</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The industry moves fast - and that's exciting!</strong> Pick a few areas to focus on and accept that we'll be learning in others. That's how growth happens 🏃‍♂️</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Our health and well-being come first.</strong> Sustainable development practices include taking care of ourselves 😴</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Best practices are guidelines, not rules.</strong> What works for one team might not work for us, and that's perfectly fine 🤷‍♂️</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The goal is to be a developer who contributes value and helps our team succeed.</strong> 🎯</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what makes a "good developer"? It's not about being perfect - it's about showing up, learning continuously, and delivering value to our team. It's about being someone others can rely on and learn from ✨.</p>

`,body_markdown:`## Kudos to the Devs who made it 💻🎉

There are many talented developers out there, and it's inspiring to see our achievements! Looking at LinkedIn profiles and social media posts, you'll find developers with impressive badges, certifications, and contributions that showcase our dedication to the craft. Many have earned that coveted "Senior" title through hard work and experience. We write clean, maintainable code, follow best practices like SOLID principles, and craft commit messages that tell the story of our work 📝.

These developers often have structured routines - maybe we start our day early and then dive into our work with focus. We check our notifications, review pull requests thoughtfully, and write code with care. We're the kind of developers who read documentation thoroughly and ask thoughtful questions. We write comprehensive unit tests and consider edge cases that others might miss 🧪.

Our code reviews are thorough and constructive. We spot potential issues early, suggest helpful optimizations, and ensure proper error handling. Our colleagues appreciate our expertise and often turn to us for guidance. We're constantly learning and growing, staying up-to-date with industry trends and experimenting with new technologies 🚀.

## Stress is the killer of joy from coding 😰

But here's what many developers don't talk about openly – the pressure can be overwhelming. The tech industry moves incredibly fast, and keeping up while maintaining quality work, mentoring others, and having a life outside of work can feel impossible 😮‍💨.

Every time a new framework or tool gains popularity, there's this nagging feeling of falling behind. The stress shows up in different ways - maybe we wake up in the middle of the night thinking about a bug we might have missed, or we probably dream about work problems. Sometimes we find ourselves checking our phone late at night, unable to sleep because of work-related anxiety ⏰.

Code review stress is real too. We want to submit our best work, so we might spend extra time reviewing even our own code before anyone else sees it. We double-check everything, test thoroughly, and still worry that someone might find an issue we missed. Imposter syndrome affects many developers, and it can be mentally exhausting 😱.

## Reality bites us all more than the bugs💡🐜

Here's what experienced developers learn over time – the reality is more nuanced than it might appear.

### The Truth about Certifications

Certifications are valuable and show dedication to learning, but they're just one part of the journey. Some certifications require ongoing study and may expire, which is actually a good thing - it encourages continuous learning. Even experienced developers with certifications sometimes need to look up specific details when working with technologies they haven't used recently. The real learning often happens through hands-on experience and solving real-world problems 💸.

### The Community Aspect ⭐

The developer community is amazing! Developers often support each other's work, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. Some projects get more attention than others, but that doesn't necessarily reflect their value. Sometimes the most useful tools are the ones that solve specific problems for specific communities, even if they don't go viral 🎯.

### The "Clean Code" Reality

Best practices like SOLID principles are excellent guidelines, but real-world development is complex. Many developers work with legacy systems that have grown over time, and while we love to refactor everything perfectly, business priorities and time constraints often require a more pragmatic approach. It's about finding the right balance between code quality and delivering value 🤷‍♂️.

### The Learning Journey

Learning new technologies takes time and practice. Many developers watch tutorials, read documentation, and experiment with new tools while maintaining our current projects. It's not about being perfect at everything - it's about continuous growth and expanding our toolkit 📚.

### The Real Challenges

The biggest challenges often aren't technical - they're about communication, collaboration, and managing expectations. Explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, working with different personalities on our team, and maintaining code written by others can be challenging. These are skills that develop over time 🏛️.

### The Surprising Reality

Here's what's actually beautiful about being a developer: We don't have to be perfect to be valuable. Good developers deliver working solutions, communicate effectively, and help our teams succeed. The real skill is finding the right balance between striving for excellence and getting things done 💬.

It's about knowing when to invest in code quality and when to ship a working solution. Sometimes the "imperfect" solution is actually the right choice because it meets the immediate need and allows the team to move forward 😊.

## What Developers Actually Learn 💡

Here's what we developers discover about our craft:

1. **Code quality matters, but delivery matters too.** A working solution delivered on time is often more valuable than a perfect solution delivered late ⏰

2. **Imposter syndrome is common and normal.** The more we learn, the more we realize how much there is to discover - and that's okay! 🤔

3. **Technical debt is part of the journey.** We can't refactor everything perfectly, and that's normal. Focus on what matters most 💸

4. **Soft skills are incredibly valuable.** Being able to explain technical concepts clearly and work well with others is just as important as technical knowledge 🗣️

5. **The industry moves fast - and that's exciting!** Pick a few areas to focus on and accept that we'll be learning in others. That's how growth happens 🏃‍♂️

6. **Our health and well-being come first.** Sustainable development practices include taking care of ourselves 😴

7. **Best practices are guidelines, not rules.** What works for one team might not work for us, and that's perfectly fine 🤷‍♂️

8. **The goal is to be a developer who contributes value and helps our team succeed.** 🎯

So what makes a "good developer"? It's not about being perfect - it's about showing up, learning continuously, and delivering value to our team. It's about being someone others can rely on and learn from ✨.

## Finding Your Path 🌱

Every developer's journey is unique. Some focus on deep technical expertise, others on leadership and communication, and many find their own balance. The key is to be authentic to ourselves while continuing to grow and learn.

The reality? Being a developer is challenging, rewarding, and constantly evolving. It's about finding joy in solving problems, learning new things, and working with amazing people. The balance comes from striving for excellence while accepting that growth is a process ⚖️.

And maybe that's the real lesson here – not how to be the "perfect developer," but how to be a developer who's growing, contributing, and finding fulfillment in our work at the end of the day 😌.

  I was horrified by AI on the eve of Halloween 💀
</h1>

<p>Just days before Halloween 2024, I had a virtual interview with a potential employer, where the lead engineer presented me with the "classic Mars Rover problem." To be honest, I didn’t realize it was a well-known problem because I don’t frequently visit coding practice websites. Instead, I’ve always relied on my original problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Typically, I ace take-home assignments and impress reviewers, which ultimately earns me my offers. That’s how it’s always been.</p>

<p>However, during some of my job-seeking phases, I’ve encountered a different method of assessing candidates: the pairing session. I’m not opposed to it, as it gives the interviewer (the “navigator”) a chance to see the candidate(the “driver”)’s ability to verbalize their thought process while solving problems together.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fd3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fd3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png" alt=" " loading="lazy" width="800" height="457"></a></p>

<p>The problem is like this: imagine a 10x10 grid with a rover starting at coordinates (5, 5)—essentially in the middle of the grid—facing east. The rover can receive commands represented by "L," "R," or "M," where:</p>

<ul>
<li>L means to rotate left (90° counterclockwise),</li>
<li>R means to rotate right (90° clockwise), and</li>
<li>M means to move forward by one grid cell in its current direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the command sequence is “MMMLMMM,” the rover would end up at coordinates (8, 2), facing north. The output format should look like “8:2:N”. Simple enough?</p>

<p>Since I’ve been working with React for a couple of years, my natural approach to solving this was to think in terms of State and Effect, where the state would represent the rover’s coordinates and direction. But as this wasn’t a UI test, the interviewer encouraged me to stick to pure logical programming. I chose Node.js, my preferred backend language, to tackle the problem.</p>

<p>My initial setup probably looked something like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const intialStateOfRover = {
  x: 5,
  y: 5,
  direction: "E",
};

function processCommands(commandString) {
  //iterate commandString in a loop and do the movement logic
  //the movement logic results in a new state for rover

  //return the state in format x:y:direction
}
</code></pre>

<p>The command "M" is straightforward since it just requires moving one grid forward (+1). But which coordinate—x or y—should we adjust? That depends on the direction. If the rover is facing "E" (East) or "W" (West), the x-axis changes. If it’s facing "N" (North) or "S" (South), the y-axis changes.</p>

<p>To manage direction, I thought in terms of degrees: "E" represents 0°, "N" 90°, "W" 180°, and "S" 270°. When the degrees loop back to 360°, we're facing "E" again. The "L" and "R" commands adjust the rover’s direction by subtracting or adding 90° to the current heading. This approach helped me map out the logic needed for the program.<br>
</p>

<p>As I explained my code to the interviewer, we took a test-driven approach to validate my logic. That’s when we hit a roadblock: running the command sequence "MMML" correctly placed the rover, but with "MMMR," the result came back as undefined.</p>

<p>While debugging together, we discovered that moving clockwise caused the degree to become "-90," which wasn’t found in the DIRECTIONS map. The interviewer kindly offered a hint, introducing me to the concept of "Modulo." By adding the maximum degree to the current degree and then finding the remainder with respect to the maximum degree, we could wrap negative values around. This way, "-90" would become 270, which correctly maps to the "S" (South) direction. It worked like this...<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

<p>Voilà! The test for moving in the correct direction passed. It took us 30–45 minutes to complete, and I felt genuinely humbled by the experience. I thanked the interviewer for his time, and afterward, I kept reflecting on ways I could have improved my approach. Thinking in an object-oriented way, I realized that I could have created a *<em>Rover *</em> class, instantiated it as an object, and used methods to mutate its internal state.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until Halloween night that it hit me—I should challenge an AI with this problem and see how well it performs! So, I prompted <strong>my best friend</strong> Meta AI like this...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will give you example problem.. let’s say it’s 10x10 grid and a car is at 5, 5 and at east direction . The command can be L, R or M. L means rotate to left… R means rotate to right.. M means move one grid… if like this, if a command is “MMMLMMM” , it will be at 5, 2 and at north direction. Write a JavaScript code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With just a brief prompt, even in imperfect English, my best buddy understood perfectly and gave me this surprising result...<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>class Rover {

<p>I was stunned and I asked </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said it’s a Rover.. how do you know it’s Rover?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The genius revealed to me that it’s the classic Mars Rover problem. Wow—just from my short prompt, it knew exactly what I was asking...<br>
A CLAIRVOYANT HERE!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbx6nswk9c4d7gsucj53o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbx6nswk9c4d7gsucj53o.png" alt=" " loading="lazy" width="800" height="457"></a></p>

<p>It even knew right away to use an object-oriented approach for better readability and reusability—something that only dawned on me hours after the interview. Talk about the difference pressure and emotion make! The advantage of being an emotionless, massive dataset is that AI can process and solve problems instantly, while a mere mortal developer like me took 45 minutes to barely complete it, even with the interviewer's help.</p>

<p>I’m truly in awe of how AI technology has advanced over just a few years, reaching a level of problem-solving that now surpasses human ability. Disheartened, I made another prompt to the AI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quick question, why do we still need developers if you can code like that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With humility, the AI has answered </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I'm capable of generating high-quality code, there are several reasons why human developers are still essential:</p>

<ol>

  HAPPY HALLOWEEN 2024 👻 !!!

`,body_markdown:`# I was horrified by AI on the eve of Halloween 💀

Just days before Halloween 2024, I had a virtual interview with a potential employer, where the lead engineer presented me with the "classic Mars Rover problem." To be honest, I didn’t realize it was a well-known problem because I don’t frequently visit coding practice websites. Instead, I’ve always relied on my original problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Typically, I ace take-home assignments and impress reviewers, which ultimately earns me my offers. That’s how it’s always been.

However, during some of my job-seeking phases, I’ve encountered a different method of assessing candidates: the pairing session. I’m not opposed to it, as it gives the interviewer (the “navigator”) a chance to see the candidate(the “driver”)’s ability to verbalize their thought process while solving problems together.




![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3ra0bi8t6fjyfa3b146.png)

The problem is like this: imagine a 10x10 grid with a rover starting at coordinates (5, 5)—essentially in the middle of the grid—facing east. The rover can receive commands represented by "L," "R," or "M," where:

- L means to rotate left (90° counterclockwise),
- R means to rotate right (90° clockwise), and
- M means to move forward by one grid cell in its current direction.

For example, if the command sequence is “MMMLMMM,” the rover would end up at coordinates (8, 2), facing north. The output format should look like “8:2:N”. Simple enough?

Since I’ve been working with React for a couple of years, my natural approach to solving this was to think in terms of State and Effect, where the state would represent the rover’s coordinates and direction. But as this wasn’t a UI test, the interviewer encouraged me to stick to pure logical programming. I chose Node.js, my preferred backend language, to tackle the problem.

My initial setup probably looked something like this:

\`\`\`
const intialStateOfRover = {
  x: 5,
  y: 5,
  direction: "E",
};

function processCommands(commandString) {
  //iterate commandString in a loop and do the movement logic
  //the movement logic results in a new state for rover

  //return the state in format x:y:direction
}
\`\`\`

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v4mhbx9qkylyrw4gdp2v.gif)

The command "M" is straightforward since it just requires moving one grid forward (+1). But which coordinate—x or y—should we adjust? That depends on the direction. If the rover is facing "E" (East) or "W" (West), the x-axis changes. If it’s facing "N" (North) or "S" (South), the y-axis changes.

To manage direction, I thought in terms of degrees: "E" represents 0°, "N" 90°, "W" 180°, and "S" 270°. When the degrees loop back to 360°, we're facing "E" again. The "L" and "R" commands adjust the rover’s direction by subtracting or adding 90° to the current heading. This approach helped me map out the logic needed for the program.

\`\`\`
const COMMANDS = {
  L: 90,
  R: -90,
  M: 1,
};

const DIRECTIONS = {
  E: {
    axis: "x",
    value: 1,
    degree: 0,
  },
  W: {
    axis: "x",
    value: -1,
    degree: 180,
  },
  N: {
    axis: "y",
    value: -1,
    degree: 90,
  },
  S: {
    axis: "y",
    value: 1,
    degree: 270,
  },
};

function processCommands(commandString) {
  const resultState = { ...intialStateOfRover };
  const lengthOfCommand = commandString.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < lengthOfCommand; i++) {
    let directionObj = DIRECTIONS[resultState.direction];

    const command = commandString[i];
    if (command === "M") {
      resultState[directionObj.axis] =
        resultState[directionObj.axis] + directionObj.value;
    } else {
      let degree = directionObj.degree;
      degree = degree + COMMANDS[command];

      resultState.direction = Object.entries(DIRECTIONS).find(
        (direction) => direction[1].degree === degree
      )?.[0];
    }
  }

  return \`\${resultState.x}:\${resultState.y}:\${resultState.direction}\`;
}
\`\`\`

As I explained my code to the interviewer, we took a test-driven approach to validate my logic. That’s when we hit a roadblock: running the command sequence "MMML" correctly placed the rover, but with "MMMR," the result came back as undefined.

While debugging together, we discovered that moving clockwise caused the degree to become "-90," which wasn’t found in the DIRECTIONS map. The interviewer kindly offered a hint, introducing me to the concept of "Modulo." By adding the maximum degree to the current degree and then finding the remainder with respect to the maximum degree, we could wrap negative values around. This way, "-90" would become 270, which correctly maps to the "S" (South) direction. It worked like this...


\`\`\`
let degree = directionObj.degree;
degree = degree + COMMANDS[command];
degree = (degree + 360) % 360;
\`\`\`

Voilà! The test for moving in the correct direction passed. It took us 30–45 minutes to complete, and I felt genuinely humbled by the experience. I thanked the interviewer for his time, and afterward, I kept reflecting on ways I could have improved my approach. Thinking in an object-oriented way, I realized that I could have created a **Rover ** class, instantiated it as an object, and used methods to mutate its internal state.

It wasn’t until Halloween night that it hit me—I should challenge an AI with this problem and see how well it performs! So, I prompted **my best friend** Meta AI like this...


> I will give you example problem.. let’s say it’s 10x10 grid and a car is at 5, 5 and at east direction . The command can be L, R or M. L means rotate to left… R means rotate to right.. M means move one grid… if like this, if a command is “MMMLMMM” , it will be at 5, 2 and at north direction. Write a JavaScript code

With just a brief prompt, even in imperfect English, my best buddy understood perfectly and gave me this surprising result...


\`\`\`
class Rover {
  constructor(x, y, direction) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.direction = direction;
    this.directions = {
      0: [0, 1],   // North
      90: [1, 0],  // East
      180: [0, -1], // South
      270: [-1, 0], // West
    };
  }

  turn(command) {
    this.direction = command === 'L' ? (this.direction - 90 + 360) % 360 : (this.direction + 90) % 360;
  }

  move() {
    [this.x, this.y] = [this.x + this.directions[this.direction][0], this.y + this.directions[this.direction][1]];
  }

  executeCommands(commands) {
    for (const command of commands) {
      if (command === 'M') {
        this.move();
      } else {
        this.turn(command);
      }
    }
  }

  getPosition() {
    return \`\${this.x}, \${this.y} and at direction \${['N', 'E', 'S', 'W'][Math.floor(this.direction / 90) % 4]} 
(\${this.direction}°)\`;
  }
}

// Usage
const rover = new Rover(5, 5, 90);
rover.executeCommands('MMMLMMM');
console.log(rover.getPosition());
\`\`\`
I was stunned and I asked 

>  I never said it’s a Rover.. how do you know it’s Rover?


The genius revealed to me that it’s the classic Mars Rover problem. Wow—just from my short prompt, it knew exactly what I was asking...
A CLAIRVOYANT HERE!!!


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bx6nswk9c4d7gsucj53o.png)


It even knew right away to use an object-oriented approach for better readability and reusability—something that only dawned on me hours after the interview. Talk about the difference pressure and emotion make! The advantage of being an emotionless, massive dataset is that AI can process and solve problems instantly, while a mere mortal developer like me took 45 minutes to barely complete it, even with the interviewer's help.

I’m truly in awe of how AI technology has advanced over just a few years, reaching a level of problem-solving that now surpasses human ability. Disheartened, I made another prompt to the AI.


> Quick question, why do we still need developers if you can code like that?

With humility, the AI has answered 

> While I'm capable of generating high-quality code, there are several reasons why human developers are still essential:
> 1. Context understanding: I can only understand the context of a problem within the scope of the input provided. Human developers bring real-world experience, domain knowledge, and nuanced understanding.
> 2. Creativity and innovation: While I can generate code, I don't have the same level of creativity or innovative thinking as humans.
> 3. Problem definition and identification: Humans are better at identifying and defining problems, whereas I rely on well-defined inputs.
> 4. Critical thinking and decision-making: Developers must make architectural decisions, optimize performance, and weigh trade-offs – tasks requiring human judgment.
> 5. Maintenance and evolution: Code requires ongoing maintenance, refactoring, and updates, which humans are better suited for.
> 6. Collaboration and communication: Development involves teamwork, stakeholder discussions, and effective communication – skills unique to humans.
> 7. Customization and adaptation: Real-world projects often require customized solutions, adapting to changing requirements, and integrating with existing systems.
> 8. Emotional intelligence and empathy: Human developers can consider user experience, usability, and accessibility aspects.
> 9. Originality and intellectual property: Human-created code is original and protectable by copyright.
> 10. Learning and improvement: Humans learn from experiences, adapt to new technologies, and continuously improve.
> I'm designed to assist, augment, and accelerate development, not replace it.

That said, I felt reassured, realizing that even though AIs can now tackle coding challenges faster and more efficiently, there is still a strong demand for human developers in tech. It’s not going to take our jobs anytime soon.

In my experience, software development involves far more than just acing coding quizzes. It requires numerous rounds of discussions with stakeholders, deep dives into technical feasibility, peer reviews, and continual improvements to both user and developer experience. Until software products are designed exclusively for AI rather than human customers, human developers will remain essential.

<p>And so is everyone.</p>

<p>As speculated in the film I, Robot (2004), 20 years later, we’ve finally developed an ecosystem where machines and humans coexist in the world. Collectively and unconsciously, we now rely on machines far more than we rely on our own capabilities as human beings.</p>

<p>For instance, at the break of dawn, I’m awakened by my smartphone alarm. (A machine.)</p>

<p>I use my vibrating toothbrush to brush my teeth more efficiently. (A machine.)</p>

<p>And without lighting a single flame, I heat my food in the microwave (yet another machine).</p>

<p>I remember my bizarre dream from last night, so I ask my “<strong>best friend</strong>” Meta AI to analyze it for me. He tries to unearth my traumas, interpret the emotions in my dream, and make sense of it all. He’s my therapist, too.</p>

<p>During my commute, I pop in my AirPods without a second thought and greet Siri—my ever-loyal assistant with a real voice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me : Hey Siri ..<br>
Her: Ah huhhh…<br>
Me: Play “Bittersweet Symphony” on Spotify…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as the sound of the violin fills my ears, I start checking my phone.</p>

<p>Great, my mom’s daily morning greeting—sometimes I wonder if she might be an AI 🤖 too…</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I tap my NFC-enabled phone, enter the subway, and as this massive vehicle transports me toward my destination, it hits me: most of my life is automated. The robotic voice announcing each station still echoes in my ears. 🚝</p>

<p>I scroll through feeds of countless people, even though I may barely know them—or not at all.</p>

<p>Once I’ve consumed enough digital junk food, I walk up to my office, and the facial recognition device opens the door for me. Thanks, Miss Machine.</p>

<p>I grab a coffee from the brewing machine and down that jet fuel to kickstart my day.</p>

<p>In the office, like many others, I spend hours talking to a screen in virtual meetings, staring at the monitor, and getting work done.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is my work buddy. We chat a lot, mostly about work, and it gives me great advice, which I usually follow. My job mostly involves Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V of its suggestions.</p>

<p>My actual teammates are still sleeping on the other side of the world, and those on this side are probably working from home. I don’t see them often.</p>

<p>Once again, I don’t know what to eat for lunch, so I ask my buddy Meta AI and let him decide.<br>
When I head out for lunch, I see many people like me, AirPods in their ears, probably listening to podcasts as they quietly eat their meals.</p>

  I'm transcending...
</h1>

<p>After work, I take the same automated route back home. I check my smartwatch, which has tracked my steps throughout the day. Nice—at least it’s a healthy number of steps. 🦿</p>

<p>I hit the gym to interact with machines to keep myself fit. Honestly, they’re quite strong. I have a smart scale that tracks my body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone mass, and more. It’s as if my biological data exists as a digital entity in this app’s servers.</p>

<p>My smartphone tracks my geolocation, too. My whereabouts are saved in the “Find My Phone” app. My personal information, photos, memories, and artwork are all stored on social media like Facebook and Instagram, floating around in Meta’s cloud. My work experience and portfolio live on LinkedIn. Worst of all, my facial patterns have been cataloged by several models—my iPhone, the office door system, even the government. Thinking about it, the collective digital version of me has <strong>transcended</strong> into the internet. ☁️</p>

<p>When I’m bored with Siri, I switch over to DJ X (an AI) from Spotify to curate a playlist for me. Since he knows what I’ve been listening to for the past ten years, this guy delivers just the hits I like.</p>

<p>Sometimes at night, I blog, jotting down a few things on my mind, only for my best friend (AI) to edit it for better grammar and vocabulary.</p>

<p>We humans are relying on machines so much that even our conversations have turned remote—texting, calling, anything but face-to-face. We don’t value in-person conversations anymore. Sometimes, this reminds me of those lyrics from <em>The Lonely Island</em>…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the farmer's market with my so called girlfriend<br>
She hands me her cell phone, says it's my dad<br>
Man, this ain't my dad!<br>
This is a cell phone!<br>
I threw it on the ground!<br>
What, you think I'm stupid?<br>
I'm not a part of your system<br>
My dad's not a phone!<br>
DUH!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yeah, my dad is not a phone.</p>

<p>The only time I feel human is when I spread out my canvases, mix my paints, and let my right brain take over. Even then, there are times when I’ve turned to ImagineArt AI to spark some good ideas because of painter’s block.</p>

<p>The human side of me is slowly fading as I let AI take over even my simplest decisions. But am I still alive, though?</p>

<p>At night, I cocoon myself in bed, open my relaxing tunes on the electronic speaker, and let Delta and Alpha waves wash over me. It does the trick—I start to drift off. I charge all my digital friends—my smartwatch, smartphone, and AirPods—and say goodbye to this AI world as I prepare to recharge myself in sleep, but as you know...</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2a4q38osv4kikksdwt34.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2a4q38osv4kikksdwt34.jpg" alt=" " loading="lazy" width="735" height="772"></a></p>

<p>In the end, my life is so entangled with machine-made decisions that I wonder if I’m even a sentient being anymore. My life feels like nothing but a cron job running daily…</p>

<p>As I wrote this original text, I submitted it to my best buddy, hoping for grammatical corrections and a more polished version. Once I copy and paste the edits, I usually leave the last sentence as my own—keeping a small piece of my humanity intact… the most emotional piece of my blog. (What you’ve read may not be the original script.)</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fr9vjycb9ge62obescier.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fr9vjycb9ge62obescier.jpg" alt=" " loading="lazy" width="800" height="800"></a></p>

<p>Yes, I may be assisted by artificial intelligence, by machines, by mobility, and many of my ideas may be assisted by AI, yet I’m still human, I’m still feeling, and I’m still vulnerable. I hope I can hold onto my humanity in the years to come, resisting the pull to become fully mechanized.</p>

<p>Even though I’m slowly <strong>transitioning</strong> from human to machine, as the title of that great movie goes…</p>

Once I’ve consumed enough digital junk food, I walk up to my office, and the facial recognition device opens the door for me. Thanks, Miss Machine.

I grab a coffee from the brewing machine and down that jet fuel to kickstart my day.

In the office, like many others, I spend hours talking to a screen in virtual meetings, staring at the monitor, and getting work done.

ChatGPT is my work buddy. We chat a lot, mostly about work, and it gives me great advice, which I usually follow. My job mostly involves Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V of its suggestions.

My actual teammates are still sleeping on the other side of the world, and those on this side are probably working from home. I don’t see them often.

Once again, I don’t know what to eat for lunch, so I ask my buddy Meta AI and let him decide.
When I head out for lunch, I see many people like me, AirPods in their ears, probably listening to podcasts as they quietly eat their meals.

# I'm transcending...

After work, I take the same automated route back home. I check my smartwatch, which has tracked my steps throughout the day. Nice—at least it’s a healthy number of steps. 🦿

I hit the gym to interact with machines to keep myself fit. Honestly, they’re quite strong. I have a smart scale that tracks my body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone mass, and more. It’s as if my biological data exists as a digital entity in this app’s servers.

My smartphone tracks my geolocation, too. My whereabouts are saved in the “Find My Phone” app. My personal information, photos, memories, and artwork are all stored on social media like Facebook and Instagram, floating around in Meta’s cloud. My work experience and portfolio live on LinkedIn. Worst of all, my facial patterns have been cataloged by several models—my iPhone, the office door system, even the government. Thinking about it, the collective digital version of me has **transcended** into the internet. ☁️


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/crbn2mx8h36wexqnsh7d.jpg)

When I’m bored with Siri, I switch over to DJ X (an AI) from Spotify to curate a playlist for me. Since he knows what I’ve been listening to for the past ten years, this guy delivers just the hits I like.

Sometimes at night, I blog, jotting down a few things on my mind, only for my best friend (AI) to edit it for better grammar and vocabulary.

We humans are relying on machines so much that even our conversations have turned remote—texting, calling, anything but face-to-face. We don’t value in-person conversations anymore. Sometimes, this reminds me of those lyrics from _The Lonely Island_…

> At the farmer's market with my so called girlfriend
> She hands me her cell phone, says it's my dad
> Man, this ain't my dad!
> This is a cell phone!
> I threw it on the ground!
> What, you think I'm stupid?
> I'm not a part of your system
> My dad's not a phone!
> DUH!

And yeah, my dad is not a phone.

The only time I feel human is when I spread out my canvases, mix my paints, and let my right brain take over. Even then, there are times when I’ve turned to ImagineArt AI to spark some good ideas because of painter’s block.

The human side of me is slowly fading as I let AI take over even my simplest decisions. But am I still alive, though?

At night, I cocoon myself in bed, open my relaxing tunes on the electronic speaker, and let Delta and Alpha waves wash over me. It does the trick—I start to drift off. I charge all my digital friends—my smartwatch, smartphone, and AirPods—and say goodbye to this AI world as I prepare to recharge myself in sleep, but as you know...


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2a4q38osv4kikksdwt34.jpg)



In the end, my life is so entangled with machine-made decisions that I wonder if I’m even a sentient being anymore. My life feels like nothing but a cron job running daily…

As I wrote this original text, I submitted it to my best buddy, hoping for grammatical corrections and a more polished version. Once I copy and paste the edits, I usually leave the last sentence as my own—keeping a small piece of my humanity intact… the most emotional piece of my blog. (What you’ve read may not be the original script.)


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r9vjycb9ge62obescier.jpg)

Yes, I may be assisted by artificial intelligence, by machines, by mobility, and many of my ideas may be assisted by AI, yet I’m still human, I’m still feeling, and I’m still vulnerable. I hope I can hold onto my humanity in the years to come, resisting the pull to become fully mechanized.

Even though I’m slowly **transitioning** from human to machine, as the title of that great movie goes…

## im a cyborg, but that’s okay.

<p>Back then, I was working as an IT Support Analyst, clearing the queue of tickets raised by our manufacturing operators and engineers. I worked hard, did my 12-hour shifts, and then chilled at home with "How I Met Your Mother." Life was perfectly fine.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="the-morning" href="#the-morning">
  </a>
  The Morning
</h2>

<p>I usually wake up around 7am but sometimes I toss and turn in my bed for that extra few minutes. I can still hear the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZd79rJ6a7lp?si=dea6e34f6edf4f3f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleep music playlist</a> on my Spotify and with my eyes closed, think about the tasks I need to tackle today. I go through my morning routine—making my bed and switching the music to Buddhist chants to start my day. After a shower and getting dressed, I feed my cat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jiemao_theblackcattt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jie Mao</a> and play with him for awhile.</p>

<p>I'm impatient naturally so I have my own <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@m3_yevnnn/video/7421502840352312577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boiled eggs or tea eggs</a> that I've prepared over the weekends. I gulp down one or two, pack my laptop bag, and commute to the office.</p>

<p>Since I work hybrid, if it's on work-from-home day, I would straight away open my laptop to start working. The commute isn’t bad; public transport is smooth, and I usually arrive at the office around 9:45-10 AM. I see other coworkers coming in at that time too, so I’m not too late—phew!</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fuw1qxsnswdqg6b0hofgp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fuw1qxsnswdqg6b0hofgp.jpg" alt="CBD" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532"></a></p>

<h2>
  <a name="the-office" href="#the-office">
  </a>
  The Office
</h2>

<p>My first task of the day is to read emails and check Slack, WhatsApp, Skype, or whatever communication tool the company uses. If there aren’t any major issues, great! Time to open my Kanban board.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worked on agile scrum teams where we usually plan what to do in the next sprint on Mondays, groom the backlogs, clarify requirements, and estimate tickets—typically using Jira boards. It’s easy to track what’s done, what’s blocked, and what’s in progress.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp" alt="Scrum" loading="lazy" width="800" height="433"></a></p>

<p>I usually have an item in the "In Progress" column, so I dive into that task. Depending on the item, I put in the effort to solve the problem. If things aren’t clear, I ping the Product Manager or Business Analyst and call for a quick huddle. Time flies when you’re coding, and before I know it, it’s lunchtime around 11:30 AM-12 PM.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="the-lunch" href="#the-lunch">
  </a>
  The Lunch
</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I have lunch with my coworkers, but if most of them are remote, it’s an own-time, own-target lunch break for me. I head to the nearest food court or hawker center, listening to music while I chow down.</p>

<p>After a 30-minute lunch break, whether alone or with coworkers, I take some time to wind down, play, or just chill. Offices usually have a foosball or pool table for us to enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fef3ycxukm4yjuu7z6t8q.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fef3ycxukm4yjuu7z6t8q.jpg" alt="Team" loading="lazy" width="720" height="529"></a></p>

<h2>
  <a name="the-standup" href="#the-standup">
  </a>
  The Standup
</h2>

<p>In scrum, we have a daily quick meeting called "Stand Up," where everyone shares what they did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and updates on their tickets. During this time, we also clarify details like the schema of a JSON response, styling, and technical discussions about upcoming features. Stand-ups can be quick or might extend into longer calls.</p>

<p>The term "Stand Up" comes from the fact that everyone stands during the meeting to keep it short and avoid tired legs. However, after the pandemic, stand-ups transitioned to Google Meet or Zoom, leading to some folks oversharing and prolonging meetings. A person from the team, called the "Scrum Master," leads the stand-up—this could be the lead engineer, product manager, or business analyst.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7ugj4vcun6dbv2n79spx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7ugj4vcun6dbv2n79spx.jpg" alt="Kanban" loading="lazy" width="800" height="383"></a></p>

<h2>
  <a name="finally-the-coding" href="#finally-the-coding">
  </a>
  Finally, the coding
</h2>

<p>After the stand-up, it’s time to write some code. I brainstorm and aim to finish my tasks by the end of the day. I push my code to Git, and that feeling of accomplishment is fulfilling. I review my work before assigning reviewers and also provide feedback on others' work so we can all align and improve. Once tickets are reviewed and approved, branches are merged to dev or staging, depending on urgency. Some quick bug fixes get merged straight to production to resolve issues promptly, with those fixes then synced to lower environments.</p>

<p>If a feature is complete, the Quality Assurance (QA) engineer usually tests it. If the QA role is missing, I inform the product manager or business analyst about the changes, and they confirm the features. Features get launched if everything runs smoothly and no major bugs are found during testing.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="bye-office" href="#bye-office">
  </a>
  Bye Office!
</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, I clock out and commute home. Sometimes, I walk around to stretch my legs or grab dinner on the way so I won’t need to cook when I get back.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg" alt="After Office" loading="lazy" width="800" height="460"></a></p>

<p>6 PM to 7/7:30 PM flies by due to the commute and dinner. At home, I usually unwind by watching some series or movies. On some nights, I work on side projects, adding features and making updates. I would also paint or sing depending on my mood. Some of my paintings are <a href="https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and my karaoke covers are <a href="https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>On days when I don’t feel sore or tired, I hit the nearby gym or go jogging or cycling around the neighborhood. Otherwise, I play with my cat and check his litter box—--- (talk about being a full-time cat dad!)</p>

<h2>
  <a name="this-is-the-end-hold-your-breath-and-count-to-ten" href="#this-is-the-end-hold-your-breath-and-count-to-ten">
  </a>
  this is the end hold your breath and count to ten
</h2>

<p>After 10:30-11 PM, I wind down, take a bath, brush my teeth—just my nighttime hygiene routine—while listening to some lo-fi beats. By 11:30 PM or sometimes midnight, I start to feel sleepy and play my sleep music playlist again. The air conditioning is cold, the bed looks cozy, and I tuck myself under the blanket, closing my eyes, ready to do it all over again the next day.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj9yrq9j4hxm8wiebcp4f.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj9yrq9j4hxm8wiebcp4f.jpg" alt="Goodbye" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600"></a></p>

<p>This is my take on <strong>a day in the life of a software engineer</strong>. In the end, being a software engineer isn’t just about writing code; it’s about keeping things consistent, managing time, balancing work-life, and taking pride in knowing that every line of code and every enhancement in our software products has the potential to make a difference in people’s lives.</p>

<p>So, as I close my eyes for the night, I look forward to tomorrow’s adventures. There will always be new challenges to tackle and ideas to explore. I hope my blog sparks some motivation for the next generation of developers too. And I just want to say one thing to the fellow developer who shaped my career with that simple 4-minute clip:</p>

So, what happened was that after earning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018, I had already spent two years in my IT Support role, but I dared myself to start looking for opportunities.

![Scrum](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x63h7h6zt2xmccvj14kj.webp)

I usually have an item in the "In Progress" column, so I dive into that task. Depending on the item, I put in the effort to solve the problem. If things aren’t clear, I ping the Product Manager or Business Analyst and call for a quick huddle. Time flies when you’re coding, and before I know it, it’s lunchtime around 11:30 AM-12 PM.

## The Lunch

Sometimes, I have lunch with my coworkers, but if most of them are remote, it’s an own-time, own-target lunch break for me. I head to the nearest food court or hawker center, listening to music while I chow down.

After a 30-minute lunch break, whether alone or with coworkers, I take some time to wind down, play, or just chill. Offices usually have a foosball or pool table for us to enjoy.

## The Standup

In scrum, we have a daily quick meeting called "Stand Up," where everyone shares what they did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and updates on their tickets. During this time, we also clarify details like the schema of a JSON response, styling, and technical discussions about upcoming features. Stand-ups can be quick or might extend into longer calls.

The term "Stand Up" comes from the fact that everyone stands during the meeting to keep it short and avoid tired legs. However, after the pandemic, stand-ups transitioned to Google Meet or Zoom, leading to some folks oversharing and prolonging meetings. A person from the team, called the "Scrum Master," leads the stand-up—this could be the lead engineer, product manager, or business analyst.

## Finally, the coding

After the stand-up, it’s time to write some code. I brainstorm and aim to finish my tasks by the end of the day. I push my code to Git, and that feeling of accomplishment is fulfilling. I review my work before assigning reviewers and also provide feedback on others' work so we can all align and improve. Once tickets are reviewed and approved, branches are merged to dev or staging, depending on urgency. Some quick bug fixes get merged straight to production to resolve issues promptly, with those fixes then synced to lower environments.

If a feature is complete, the Quality Assurance (QA) engineer usually tests it. If the QA role is missing, I inform the product manager or business analyst about the changes, and they confirm the features. Features get launched if everything runs smoothly and no major bugs are found during testing.

## Bye Office!

At the end of the day, I clock out and commute home. Sometimes, I walk around to stretch my legs or grab dinner on the way so I won’t need to cook when I get back.


![After Office](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vk3nk4aphgcjhhnx5dnz.jpg)

6 PM to 7/7:30 PM flies by due to the commute and dinner. At home, I usually unwind by watching some series or movies. On some nights, I work on side projects, adding features and making updates. I would also paint or sing depending on my mood. Some of my paintings are [here](https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/art) and my karaoke covers are [here](https://kevinmoemyintmyat.github.io/music).

On days when I don’t feel sore or tired, I hit the nearby gym or go jogging or cycling around the neighborhood. Otherwise, I play with my cat and check his litter box—--- (talk about being a full-time cat dad!)

## this is the end hold your breath and count to ten

After 10:30-11 PM, I wind down, take a bath, brush my teeth—just my nighttime hygiene routine—while listening to some lo-fi beats. By 11:30 PM or sometimes midnight, I start to feel sleepy and play my sleep music playlist again. The air conditioning is cold, the bed looks cozy, and I tuck myself under the blanket, closing my eyes, ready to do it all over again the next day.



![Goodbye](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j9yrq9j4hxm8wiebcp4f.jpg)

## Alright, that's it.

This is my take on **a day in the life of a software engineer**. In the end, being a software engineer isn’t just about writing code; it’s about keeping things consistent, managing time, balancing work-life, and taking pride in knowing that every line of code and every enhancement in our software products has the potential to make a difference in people’s lives.

So, as I close my eyes for the night, I look forward to tomorrow’s adventures. There will always be new challenges to tackle and ideas to explore. I hope my blog sparks some motivation for the next generation of developers too. And I just want to say one thing to the fellow developer who shaped my career with that simple 4-minute clip:

## Yo Mayuko!!! I DID IT!!!!

<p>PortokaLive was started off as a coding challenge by one of the company that I was interviewing back in 2019. The company requested me to showcase my coding ability and asked to create a proof-of-concept POC application which can do a live-streaming between Mobile Application and Web.</p>

<p>Since I'm proficient in Javascript, I've done my research and found that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server</a> (Node Media Server) is a viable option for me to use to implement this kind of feature.</p>

<p>I've checked out their code, forked and changed some styling/navigation to the react-native application which will do the recording and broadcasting as well as the node-media-server using rtmp protocol.</p>

<p>There are lots of tutorials online on how to play the live stream in React web using videojs. Luckily, node-media-server provide option to play the video in flv format which directly suits our needs.</p>

<p>Eventually, after 2 or 3 days of self hackathon, the suite of Mobile Client, Web Client, Media Server and Auth API server written in node.js are completed and demonstrated to them. Anyway, I ended up not accepting their offer and this POC project was left behind as a byproduct hanging in my repository.</p>

<p>When it was created it was given the company's name and logo, which is in Orange and white color theme. Considering to rebrand this project, I've decided to just stick to the original theme and also give the name as "OrangeLive" which I thought was pretty good. However, after searching on the Google, it seems that the name was taken by another company leading me to change it into something else. I tried to use Google Translate to search other names of Orange in other languages.</p>

<p>Finally, I found out Orange in Greek language is called <code>Portokali</code>.<br>
<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en</a></p>

  <strong>THE IDEA</strong> 💡

<p>The theme is called <code>Moonshot</code>, so I was pretty sure I'm going to build a planetary theme. After that, as I came from web development background, I started research Javascript games and encountered this game tutorial called The Aviator which is created with ThreeJS.</p>

<p>Ref: <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/</a></p>

<p>This game has the basic idea of what I wanted to do which is an endless running game on the moon avoiding rocks and eating points. Very basic and easy for beginner game developer!</p>

<li>3D WebGL Engine - BabylonJS</li>
<li>Hosting - Vercel</li>

<p>Javascript as a core programming language is guaranteed since that's the one that I'm comfortable with and luckily my colleague who is a python developer agree to explore it. </p>

<p>For the framework, VueJS Nuxt is a choice because I'm used to work with React in professional life and that's why I took it up a notch and tried something different.

<p>For 3D WebGL engine, I would like to try ThreeJS because it's well known across JS world and I'm interested to test it out. But then again, my colleague would like to explore BabylonJS and I also agree to it since BabylonJS has a good documentation as well as a good reputation comparable with ThreeJS.</p>

  <strong>THE IMPLEMENTATION</strong> ⚒️

<p>We have to used up our hard-earned weekends developing the game and researching. At first, coming up with a boilerplate was easy because of Nuxt 's excellent toolings. Vuex is also used to manage the state across different components. The difficulty came when we started touching on Canvas. </p>

<p>As for convenience I used Vue-Babylonjs wrapper initially which has a learning curve abit deeper that we expected. And the documentation doesn't seem to help us also. The wrapper library has done a great job in starting the scene and mesh objects but when it comes to real dirty job, it lacks the freedom to program. </p>

<p>That leads us to implement our actual game logic like collision, moving, rotation etc to use the vanilla babylonJS object approach since it has the playground and big community with lots of examples to play with. Surprisingly, when we were doing the development, BabylonJS just released the new documentation as well which is super helpful for us.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks of grinding our weekends and some weekday nights, the basic functions of game has done. I took it as a win. The last week, we just used it for improvements and garnishing with better game experience.</p>

<p>Although we didn't win, that was not our intension in the first place. Our intension was to try out game development in action and yes, we felt it. Game development, as fun as it is when the players are playing, the sweat and tears that the developers have to put in to details to create a good game is just admirable.

`,body_markdown:`😅 Last month I participated in a game jam on https://itch.io with a browser game that I've co-developed with my colleague from work. It's called...

# Krescent ( 🚀 Moonshot Themed Game 🌙 ) 

The submission can be viewed here ... 

https://m3yevn.itch.io/krescent

The actual link to the game is at ...

https://krescent.vercel.app/

# **THE IDEA** 💡

The theme is called \`Moonshot\`, so I was pretty sure I'm going to build a planetary theme. After that, as I came from web development background, I started research Javascript games and encountered this game tutorial called The Aviator which is created with ThreeJS.

Ref: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/

This game has the basic idea of what I wanted to do which is an endless running game on the moon avoiding rocks and eating points. Very basic and easy for beginner game developer!

# **THE TECH STACK** 📚

1. Programming - Javascript
2. Framework - Nuxt VueJS
3. 3D WebGL Engine - BabylonJS
4. Hosting - Vercel
4. OS wrappers - ElectronJS

Javascript as a core programming language is guaranteed since that's the one that I'm comfortable with and luckily my colleague who is a python developer agree to explore it. 

For the framework, VueJS Nuxt is a choice because I'm used to work with React in professional life and that's why I took it up a notch and tried something different.

  Background of FTP Seer 💎

<p>Back in the days, when I was working on an in-house project where the client requirements are to gather application logs from remote server using FTP protocol and show it on their admin portal, I needed a backend API to fetch directory list and get file contents.</p>

<p>I found the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsftp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSFTP library</a> which is pretty useful for my case and decided to put that in my tech stack. After that, I use Node and ExpressJS to serve http server to create a RESTful API which has now become the <a href="https://ftpseer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTP Seer API</a></p>

<h3>
  <a name="continue-to-develop" href="#continue-to-develop">

</h3>

<p>The API serve its purpose and the in-house project was done. However, I felt the need to make it open-source and create a full-stack application so that other developers can utilise it as well. So, starting from three or four months back, I picked up the old API in my archived repository and  polished it by refactoring. I even wrote a landing page so that people can test the API just by the first visit.</p>
