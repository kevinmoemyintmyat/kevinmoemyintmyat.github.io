Hooray! Here&#39;s the link</p><ul data-v-ad564ba9><li data-v-ad564ba9>Web ( <a href="https://portokalive.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-ad564ba9>https://portokalive.vercel.app/</a> )</li><li data-v-ad564ba9>Mobile ( <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portokalive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-ad564ba9>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portokalive</a>)</li></ul><h1 data-v-ad564ba9><a name="how-it-started-the-origin" href="#how-it-started-the-origin" data-v-ad564ba9></a> 🌞 How it started (The origin) </h1><p data-v-ad564ba9>PortokaLive was started off as a coding challenge by one of the company that I was interviewing back in 2019. The company requested me to showcase my coding ability and asked to create a proof-of-concept POC application which can do a live-streaming between Mobile Application and Web.</p><p data-v-ad564ba9>Since I&#39;m proficient in Javascript, I&#39;ve done my research and found that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-ad564ba9>https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-media-server</a> (Node Media Server) is a viable option for me to use to implement this kind of feature.</p><p data-v-ad564ba9>I&#39;ve checked out their code, forked and changed some styling/navigation to the react-native application which will do the recording and broadcasting as well as the node-media-server using rtmp protocol.</p><p data-v-ad564ba9>There are lots of tutorials online on how to play the live stream in React web using videojs. Luckily, node-media-server provide option to play the video in flv format which directly suits our needs.</p><p data-v-ad564ba9>Eventually, after 2 or 3 days of self hackathon, the suite of Mobile Client, Web Client, Media Server and Auth API server written in node.js are completed and demonstrated to them. Anyway, I ended up not accepting their offer and this POC project was left behind as a byproduct hanging in my repository.</p><h1 data-v-ad564ba9><a name="rebranding-to-another-name" href="#rebranding-to-another-name" data-v-ad564ba9></a> 💙 Rebranding to another name </h1><p data-v-ad564ba9>When it was created it was given the company&#39;s name and logo, which is in Orange and white color theme. Considering to rebrand this project, I&#39;ve decided to just stick to the original theme and also give the name as &quot;OrangeLive&quot; which I thought was pretty good. However, after searching on the Google, it seems that the name was taken by another company leading me to change it into something else. I tried to use Google Translate to search other names of Orange in other languages.</p><p data-v-ad564ba9>Finally, I found out Orange in Greek language is called <code data-v-ad564ba9>Portokali</code>.<br data-v-ad564ba9><a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-ad564ba9>https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en</a></p><p data-v-ad564ba9>And fortunately, I can omit the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;I&quot; of the <code data-v-ad564ba9>Live</code> word if I merged them together.
